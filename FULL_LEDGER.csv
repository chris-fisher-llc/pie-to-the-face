I think that's his alma mater. But since 2017,  Kansas has entered three seasons as the number one team in the country. None of those teams finished  as a top seed in the tournament and none made it pass the round of 32. You know, you kind of take it for  granted with some of these teams. And with Kansas, it feels like you you plug them in and you realize  that they're going to get to the sweet 16 or the lead aid. It's just not the case anymore. And NIO has  leveled the playing field. It's not just you're getting somebody. Somebody else is getting somebody.  Also, the transfer portal is well. But I would say Kansas is still the hunted. But I don't know how  much longer that is going to last. And you do see these coaches who have been in it. They're career,  their lifeers. And at some point, the transfer portal NIO drives them out. Coach Cate didn't want to  deal with it. Coach Saben didn't want to. Jay Wright at Villanova. You know, a lot of these coaches are like,  I got into this business because I could control everything. And they realized they are not able to  control as much as they think or they once were able to. Jonathan in Long Island,  I Jonathan, what's on your mind today? Good morning, gentlemen. Long time several times. I am  super excited. Last night was the trifecta of rare one with Pauli being absent. I think one good  soccer second day, we're having World Cup qualifiers throughout the night. UCLA was on TV. The  legers were on TV. Great night for me. I have a high to the face that with Fritzzy.  As an L.A. Transite here in Long Island, I've adopted St. John's in Ricky P in the boys.  Final four, they're coming out of the region. Up for Fritzzy because he's a Broncos guy. I give him  right a refusal. But anyone's up for it. I'd be happy to my wife with a love to throw a pie in my face.  We're spending an awesome little bit. Jonathan, no one's no.  I think most of you guys have St. John's going to the final four. Don't you?  I have them. I have them beating Duke in the National title game. So that wouldn't work for me,  Pyrrhal. So do I. Okay. Okay. You know, seat and you have St. John's going to  have them losing in the Elite 8. Okay. What about you, Dylan, the resident gambler on this show?  Not a good gambler, but a resident gambler on their show. A resident. I have them losing I think next round.  Oh, yeah. Do you want a piece of Jonathan? He's got them, uh, final four. You wouldn't happen to have them  losing to Kansas in the next round. Would you? You know, no matter fact of this.  I was going to bring that up, but yeah, I'll take that. All right, Jonathan. You got a bit  Dylan will take you up on it. He doesn't have Ricky P going much further. Let's see, Don and Ark and  saw. Hi, Don, what's on your mind today? Good morning, gentlemen. Here's what I can say.  You forgot about the the Moniker 40 minutes of hell with Nolan.  I don't like Fileslamicama anyway. Calaparie proved it last night. And I think you guys are given  Latino too much to much credit. Why don't we see what happens? Come Saturday.  Wait a minute. How am I giving Rick Petino too much credit? Well, I mean, y'all are all over St. John  and and all that kind of stuff. I think Ark and Saw story is just just just, uh, just as interesting  kind of kind of, and, uh, you know, hey, uh, there are other teams except big he's team's up there.  Oh, here we go. Here we go. We got, uh, he's ghost bias. Yes, Martin. We haven't talked about St. John's"

What are we talking about? We haven't talked about St. John's in forever. We talked more about  Arkansas and March man is we even talked about Muslims wife who I worked with at, uh, ESPN. So yes,  we have talked about Arkansas. We haven't talked about St. John's and St. John's is a pretty amazing story.  If you look at what Patinos done and revitalizing St. John's, I go back to the 80s when that was  Biggie Spasskeball at its finest. Patinos bounced around, uh, goes from my, you know, every place he's gone,  he's won. And yeah, it's a big deal. But we did talk about Connecticut if there's an East Coast bias  because they won the National Championship the two previous years. But I don't know if we're going  out of our way to say, boy, look at what Rick Patino did. You know what Calaparie did was interesting,  that he kind of wore out as welcome at Kentucky. He knew it. Kentucky went in and, you know, went out and  got Mark Pope brought him in. Calaparie goes to Arkansas. He's friends with one of the big donors there,  big boosters there. Muslim one goes to USC. I mean, John should be in the tournament. He should be  competitive. He's really good at recruiting and they got a big win last night against Kansas. So  let's see what happens coming up on Saturday. I think it's a great match up. It's fun. We do get  caught up in coach versus coach as opposed to players versus players. But that's just the familiarity  part of this. David in Ohio. Hi, David. Hey, Dan, speaking of Dylan making part of the face that  he still was me one from Taylor Swift. I am forgotten about that. Thank you. Okay, David.  David sounded a little miffed at you, Dylan. He did sound miffed. He did is right, though. I did. That was a bad  bet, but I did take it. Okay. I'm deal with you. We want to do, you're always, you guys say all the  weather's got to be at least like 49 and a half degrees before you go outside to do the pie to the face.  Yes, Barb. That's just me because I'm soft. Oh, okay. Dylan's not soft.  Well, you know, then maybe a pie to the face at the end of the show today. I don't know if you got, you know,  with your favorite wardrobe, your favorite outfit on today. I do really like this shirt. But I could do  it. I could go tarps off for the pie. Okay. Well, we could we could get you, you know, we got everything  on sale at dampatric.com. We could get you one of the t-shirts there. And we're in a perfectly good  t-shirt then. Yes. Yes, but we'll get Tyler whip up a pie and then maybe you pay off your Taylor Swift  Super Bowl bet. John and Riverside. Hi, John. What's on your mind today? Hey, good morning, fellas.

It goes  stats that stats that stats that the day stats that stats that that that that the day stats that that  that stat of the day. Here comes the stat of the day. Okay. Nailed it. Nailed it. All right, John.  Thank you, John. Thank you. That will be the first and last time you'll hear that on the show. Are you sure,  though? Yeah. I like that. I don't know. I just want to just simply wait until you guys like that. But you  don't like Pandora? Oh, my god. I have no offense, Pandora. I like that infinitely more than what  happened with that Pandora song. I love Pandora.  Thank you, Pandora. It's awesome.  Brett in Michigan. I Brett, what's on your mind today? Hey, Dan. How you doing? 5. 10. 85.  I just got a question with the new CD way process that they do in the NTA. Why is Michigan safe"
"Wed, 26 Jun 2024",Hour 1 - The Least Talked About NBA Draft,45:42,Dan Patrick,Paulie Pabst,Pie,Dan bets that Ronnie James will be drafted in round one.,Paulie Pabst,Dan Patrick,Paid,2024-06-26,"To hit multiple lead off homers in the same game.  Cole gave up four homeruns in four innings.  And failed to strike out a single batter.  Just the second time in 302 career starts.  Cole has not recorded at least one strikeout.  That is courtesy of the Met's radio network.  The play of the day is brought to you by our partners, King's Hawaiian.  Who wants you to get together with friends and family and enjoy the weekend by making every Sunday.  A slider Sunday, Pauli.  You see a showhail Otani right now in the National League.  Hit 320 lead in the league.  Homeruns 24 lead in the league.  And he's just a couple back in RBI.  He's having the best hitting season of his career.  And he hasn't cooled off yet.  I should know this, but he's not pitching, right?  Not pitching, not planning to pitch this year.  But the procedure he had, which they didn't say was Tommy Johnson.  It wasn't. It was some new procedure.  Allowed him to hit this year.  Because if he had true Tommy Johnson, he's not hitting.  He's complete rehab.  But whatever it was, which that doctor out there,  hasn't given it a name.  But he's hitting better than ever.  Coming off of Eric quotes procedure for his elbow.  You can get a chance you never pitch as again.  We discussed that about a month and a half ago when he started out to season hit like 350.  Did the Dodgers look at him and say like, well,  we could just have him as the best hitter in the game for paying him $700 million to do both.  But the pitching again risks the hitter.  Right?  Because if he pitches again and really rips up his elbow,  who knows how much time he's going there.  And they've got a lot of money invested in that man.  And in that man, Dale and Indiana, by the way,  says, I'll watch the draft just to see Ronnie go in the second round.  So DP can get a pie to the face.  That's how interesting this year's draft is to me.  What's the deal? There's a pie.  Yeah, Dan bet that Ronnie James would be drafted in round one tonight.  Oh, what was this?  I don't. He just said it's a long time ago.  Two weeks ago.  Two weeks ago.  Two weeks ago.  Okay.  Yeah.  So I, by the way, tend to agree with Dan,  like, why would you not draft Ronnie if you're ever late for a Schraum Pick  and try to leverage that asset that you know is more valuable  than these other players you could draft?  For it's he?  What if you try to leverage that unsuccessfully?  And now you're stuck with the player that you didn't want because you try to get cute  and thought you were going to get some kind of and hold them for ransom  and get something better that you never get.  Didn't LeBron take a couple years ago.  He's going to keep playing until you can play with his son.  I mean, he's literally playing just so we can play with his son.  I feel like that's a pretty good leverage.  Yeah.  He said that a few years ago and then the past couple years he's kind of stayed away from the topic.  It's more like whatever happens happens.  It'd be great, but whatever happens.  And I think this is probably why.  Because he knows people could could leverage them potentially.  Let's take a call from Karen who's in Ohio.  8773DP show.  What's up, Karen?  This is Karen from Ohio.  Verbindring can cigar smoking.  And I just want to tell you, Ross, that you have got to be the one that takes over for DP.  He retires.  Because there is no one who does it any better than you.  And if I have to listen to Manics, do it.  I do not listen anymore.  All right, Karen. Thank you for the compliment.  We're not taking shots.  Anybody else just focus on saying how great I am.  Yeah.  As opposed to tearing anyone else.  Yeah, more pro Ross.  Yes.  You look like happiness.  Let's keep it happy.  That's me.  Right. You look like happiness.  I think that's what you said yesterday.  I look like happiness.  You know, I specifically guys."

The pie was already covered.  It seemed redundant. Yeah. Pie to the ear. That's out of bounds.  And the hoodie. I'd have to see the rules. Where in a hoodie? Not wearing a hoodie.  It's a pie to the face. Not pie to the hair. So I took the pie to the fat. Took two pies. Shut up, Brent.  I took the pies. Took it like a man. How many pies did I end up with?  Did I get six?

I think there's a difference between somebody who brings the ball up,  and so much as the actual point guard that runs to offense,  leaves the league and assists or the team and assists.  So, when people say, oh, he's a great point guard, ever?  No, no, he's not.  Right.  I don't consider him. He's the greatest shooter of all time.  He's not the greatest point guard.  Because he, not a great passer.  He said it, two games where he hadn't even had an assist.  Dreyman Green usually leads the team in assist.  Steph is one of the great players of all time.  I think that's always kind of weird when you say, all right, who's the best?  Power forward.  And then you'll be like, oh, you know, Tim Duncan, because he's got five titles.  If you said, all right, give me the 15 best players, no position.  You know, then do you put it, you know, where's Tim Duncan with that?  But when you say, hey, best power forward of all time, because Bird wasn't a power forward.  Kevin McAill was power forward.  Which I don't know.  When you have those kind of titles, it's always awkward.  Like I don't know what Dirk Nebitsky was.  Like what was he? Was he a three? Was he a four?  Yes, more.  And then in the mid 2000s, you had all those great seven footers, Rashid,  Wallace, Dirk, Nebitsky Kevin, Garnet, that would have been centers in the 80s.  And then they were power forwards.  And then you had guys like Theo Ratliffe, they made all NBA teams,  because he was listed as a center.  It's reference.  Yeah.  Theo Ratliffe.  See, that's one of like, they all NBA team.  We got to have a center.  I don't know.  DeAndre Jordan.  Yeah, DeAndre Jordan, I go, he's not one of the top 30, 50 best players in the NBA.  Top five that year. Yeah, he was.  Yeah.

Like to offer you the fireball that since we were with me at the Nerding  tailgate in 2015, today is the fireball that all the phones are around.  I don't want to do a fireball.  Matt, how crazy was that?  All I wanted was a beer.  And I walk up to the tailgate and everybody was doing fireballs.  And I said, all right, if it means I get a beer, I'll do a fireball.  As soon as I took that shot, I was getting ready.  There were 15 cameras there.  Camera, I go, no, no, no, we're not doing this.  No, we're not doing this.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry.  I'm not going to blame you, you know, specifically, but all I wanted was a beer.  We were there for the USC game.  When we're, I kept thinking, this is no today.  There's gotta be people just handed out beer.  All right, who wants a piece of Matt?  Matt's got no today.  I'm winning it all.  Anybody going to go against the funding at Todd?  No, I can see them winning it all.  Okay.  All right.  Um, I can probably go against it.  All right, Matt, seat is going to go against you.  Love it.  Let's go Irish, baby.  All right.  All right.  How's this going to go over at home, seat and you're betting against the Irish?  Yeah, no, my nephew goes there right now.  So I'm sure that that's out of the family is not happy with it.  But why not make it more interesting?  I got to admit though, I don't have a lot of faith in them.  I love them.  They're great, but I don't have a lot of faith in them to do that.  All right.

We've got Wemble in quarterfinals continuing men's in the women's, the men's US Olympic  team's scrimmages in Vegas and all we can do is talk about a 17 year old who's headed to Duke,  Cooper Flag will have that for you home run Derby competitors.  We're announced this is the only time out of the year that I see Peter Lanzo.  It feels like.  I know we placed for the match.  He's in a big market a bit of feels like every time when I watching home run Derby.  I go, oh, Peter Lanzo.  That's right.  He's still in major league baseball.  And he may win it again.  I don't watch you any other nights, any other days, but it seems like that brings out the  best in Peter Lanzo who's going to be my pick for home run Derby.  I don't know who else is in there.  We take the field.  You can have the field for a pie to the face for everybody.  I mean.  Yes, I know everybody keeps saying, you get your part of the face.  Hey, when you get your pies to the face, Friday Friday, we'll get four pies to the face.  Each day and a get some pie.  I will take the pie to the face.  I made a bet.  I thought, Ronnie James, you know, all these NBA GMs, you know, they made a mistake.  They could have taken Ronnie in the first round.  I tried to tell him, but no, he's got to go in this second round here.  Yes, you.  Would you rather win the home run Derby or the slim dunk contest?  Well, or while you're a shooter, so three point three point shoot.  Definitely three point shooting over slam dunk.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay, what about three point shooting or home run Derby?  They're probably more similar.  Well, it feels like we give more credit now, more validation, more notoriety to the three  point shooting contest than home run Derby.  Right?  I don't know if we.  Home run Derby's kind of pass a we still love watching guy shoot the three or women shoot  the three and the clock is ticking.  So there's there's that element of not just standing there shooting, you got to shoot and then  you got to go through all the racks.  So I would say three point shooting contest probably is held in higher regard than home run Derby  and slam dunk.  What about you?  You once slammed dunked, don't you?  Well, yes, yeah.  I mean, I could shoot a three.  I could hit a home run.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I've dunked before.  Yeah, see, that's why for you.  It's like, yeah.  This isn't fun.  Yeah.  Marvin, what about you?  Slame dunk contest.  We remember Spud Web.  Give it a year, not Spud Web.  Like if you're five four, then that's why we remember you.  Spud Web was six two.  We wouldn't remember him.  Well, being six feet.  So I'm six feet tall.  So you're like deep round.  I'd rather be deep round.  Okay.  All right.  Yes, I think you're right.  Maybe we should take the slam dunk contest out of it and just do three point reverses  home run Derby.  Because you know what, if I could just, when how many chances throughout the day do you get to  go hit a bunch of home runs, almost never."

I thought it was awesome. We all feel it.  You know, and you asked something like, well, how so after Pete Bavak was, you know,  response to one of the questions. But my question for you is, have we thought about what would have  happened in Virginia had one that game and gotten into represent the ACC with all of the money,  the talks, the contracts, both in the room that are buying for ACC and what that money means not only  to a team, but to an entire conference in the landscape. I just wonder if Virginia had won  to that allow Notre Dame to stay put versus being moved down and sitting on their couch. So just  a thought and thanks for all you guys do to keep me laughing every morning. Have a good one.  Thank you, Devon. Well, Miami moved ahead of Notre Dame and they would have gotten in.  I'm guessing, you know, which Virginia guaranteed of getting into the playoffs if they won the ACC?  Yes, because they were ranked going into the game. What was their ranking though?  Yes, Marvin. I know they were 10 and 2. Yeah, yeah. And it's not to say they weren't worthy of it,  but I wasn't following. I was actually rooting for Duke to win because it would just be chaos.  The five lost team is in the ACC title game. Yeah, Pauli. Virginia was ranked 17th in the country  going into the game. Okay. So that means they're automatic. I've got to check what would have been out.  Okay. It's hard to keep up with the math of all of this or the logic I should say or the lack there of  let's see. Becky and Wisconsin. Hi, Becky. What's on your mind?  Good morning, guys. I just wanted to say happy holidays, everybody, and I got to click  wager for top on it. Oh, I was hoping since I'm a big tag of fan, I could do a straight up win  loss at how do the face this weekend for some days game. Todd Green Bay Denver in Denver.  Hi to the face with Becky and Wisconsin. Let's do it. It's going to be a time one and they're due  for a loss of the way to 10 straight, but you know what, they're in Denver. I'm hoping that will give us that  mile high magic edge. Okay. All right. You got to bet there, Becky.  All right. Um, Adam and LA. Hi, Adam. What's on your mind today?  Good morning, D.P. appreciate you. Hey, just had a quick question and then the side of the day.  Quick question would be since Nora Dame didn't get in. If you thought that they should get in,  who would you have taken out what it had been James Madison, Tulane, and then if it was both,  which I think it should have been both. I don't do my two-an and James Madison both,  man. I get the rules, whatever, but one of the attacks this would have been Vanity. And then  my quick fact of the day was, yeah, confirmed 1978. It says less sports bro says that J. L.  Hirst the first player and NF history to throw an interception and a humble on this same play. Pretty  crazy to see. But yeah, go ahead and tell me what you feel about those two teams that you would have had  in, so, um, two-an and then. Thank you. I'm glad they got in. Like I still root for the underdog  because there's going to be a time when these teams won't get a chance to play in the playoffs because  I do think that we'll go to a more professional model. Yes, Pauli. There has to be some type of reward  for winning your way in with the group of five or you just get rid of the group of five conferences and just tell  them, you have no place in this playoff. Yeah, and you know, we saw that with Boisey stay. We saw that  with Arizona State. Now, I don't think they deserve first round by as like they did last year.  To Lane and J.M. You, they lose their coaches. Um, now they do come back. I think to be able to coach,  which I'm glad that they're doing that. It's just been and we talked about this six weeks ago. I was  informed by somebody who said a sort said, there's going to be so much of a people. Well, we've seen"

I mean, what what we're showing you is all pretty.  It's all beautiful.  But, you know, there's the reality of people, countries think, well, this is, this is going to help us.  We're going to get money.  The infrastructure going to prove all of this.  And a couple of those certainly grease and in Rio.  They, they didn't recover from that.  Yeah.  Phil and Pennsylvania.  I feel what's on your mind today.  Dan always a great pleasure to talk to you, my friend.  I think if you're looking at the word carnage, very much after poof, you're the Florida Marlins every year.  And as far as as far as the, the pool, Dan,  I'm with you.  How do you, how do you not have a standardized pool?  How can you even look at records having any kind of consistency?  So I'd love to hear your thoughts on that, always a pleasure, buddy.  All right.  Thank you Phil.  Yeah.  We're trying to get a hold of some of our best people.  Why the, the Olympic swimming pool has a different depth than maybe other ones that are used.  And maybe that's why we're not getting Olympic record.  Yes, Marvin.  And also it's the Miami Marlins, not the Florida Marlins.  Yeah, yeah, let's piece.  Let's not put the blame on the entire state of Florida, just Miami there with the Marlins.  Patrick and North Carolina.  Good morning, Patrick.  Morning, Dan.  Call G. yesterday about the most impactful trade at the deadline and low and behold,  trades are with our just in terms of two, maybe last night, the Marlins.  So I think you got that answer.  Okay.  And I wanted to propose a pie to the face bed for the toddler back there.  Okay, Todd Patrick has a pie to the face bed for you.  What do we got?  Well, I am my Mariners.  I guess you're astros just who wins the West or if you'd rather we can see who goes further in the playoffs.  Let's do it.  Why not?  Okay.  So we got a bet.  Pie to the face, which team goes further in the postseason?  Patrick Mariners and my Astros who goes further up for the season into the playoffs.  Okay.  That sounds like a bad.  All right, Patrick.  Thank you for calling in.  Yes, yes, Paul.  I do have an update on Olympic pool.  The depth in feet.  It has to be between 6.5 and 9.8 feet deep.  Missy Franklin, remember the great swimmer?  She talked about it in the interview and she said that the more shallow the pool again, they call it slow pools.  They call it.  And this one is 7 and 1 half feet in Paris.  So it's a little on the shallow side.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you.  Back to you.  By the way, you know, I was we played a clip from John L.way.  He was being interviewed, pardon my take and they were talking about he was playing golf with Josh Allen recently and they asked,  How long did it take before Josh Allen brought up that John L.way passed on drafting Josh Allen.  He said two and a half holes and then he brought it up to him.  But you start to think about L.way graduated from Stanford.  He took Brock Osweiler, he took Paxton Lynch, he passed on Josh Allen, he took Drew Lock 42nd over all in 2019.  Sometimes the grades aren't great talent evaluators.  And Michael Jordan, case in point, Kwame Brown, Adam Morrison, Wiff, Wiff.  But you would think Mike would be looking for someone that had characteristics of himself that played the same way.  I cared the same.  I don't know how you could look at Kwame Brown's game and granted it was high school and go, yep.  Unless Mike, you know, fell victim to, well, all those fails, draft height.  I mean, those are two big misses there.  Adam Morrison was a wonderful college player.  But couldn't play in the NBA."

And he gets, he gets that sort of label of like, well, his defense is carrying it.  Uh, which may or may not be true.  However, he still had it. He still had a pretty great weekend.  Okay.  Um, Trevor Lawrence.  Ooh.  Maybe he had one of the best games of his career, probably, right?  Has to be the best game accounted for six touchdowns.  I mean, that's, yeah, that was great.  Uh, and those are your four.  Okay.  Brock Perti, Josh Allen, CJ Straud, Trevor Lawrence.  Maybe there's others if anyone else would like to populate.  I would put Trevor Lawrence in there because like we still want to see this.  And the fact that he showed that he's capable of doing this.  You know, that, that's what surprised me.  I mean, everybody's played the, you know, those who played the judge.  How many, you know, quarterbacks have put up these kind of numbers.  We're still waiting to see it with a real Trevor Lawrence.  Please stand up.  That's yeah. You keep, we keep getting every once in a while.

People said that would be a disaster and it fell reporters and,  Analysts said to be a disaster. He was 18 for 27 1 20 in a touchdown.  and he kept a minute. He was only sacked once. He didn't run for a yard because he didn't want to.  But he had that he drove them down just enough to get a fuel goal to take the lead. He didn't give it up.  Yes, Todd. I would vote for Trevor Lawrence, but I think at least an also ran,  oh, Nick's four touchdowns over 300 yards against Green Bay. Should be mentioned.  Yeah, shocker. Shocker. It should be in the mix of the discussion.  Yeah.  Okay, sure not watching on Peacock Todd is decked out in his Broncos.  I had a good Broncos shirt. Yeah.  Now could I wear that in lieu of taking a pie to the face if I wore that sweater on Friday the entire day?  Seems like an easy way out. You know, in the spirit of the holidays I would probably allow it so that you don't have to get the pie in the  face because I'm a good guy like that. I think that would be an unobal gesture. I thought you're doubled down on Friday.  I had the bet with the Wisconsin lady and then you didn't know. No, it was going to take away my pie if Green Bay won.  I didn't double down. He, you know, we had a caller who said, hey, if Green Bay wins, then Dan doesn't take the pie to the face  and whatever the other wording was with that bet that I, it was either I was getting a pie or not.  I'm going to get a pie on Friday.  And when people call in, you know, I'm assuming that this is true. If you lose, they have to send in an actual video so we can  have fun with it with a look and see that they actually took the pie to the face. They can't just say we got to pie to the face.  No, we have people who send them in, Todd. I don't know, but I was making sure everyone does that.  Well, why don't you write them down then? I should. Why don't you keep track? Are you owed a pie to the face?  Um, yeah, well, for her, for the Packard Bronco bed and the us with the 12 and two, two and 12, the Bronco is right.  No, no, no, you don't get a pie to the face.

What's on your mind?  Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my call. I watch in the world series yesterday and, you know,  I know it's a, it was the bullpen game anyways for the Dodgers. But that bullpen game didn't look equal to,  you know, the pod rays or the met's bullpen game. You know, they didn't bring it co-picked. They didn't bring it  grader all. You know, for as much as Dave Roberts was saying, don't let him up for air. I think you kind of got the sense that  he didn't, he didn't want to risk it all on all his big arms. Yeah, you might be right on that. It might be one of those.  You know, what? Maybe we can somehow win this game, sweep the Yankees. But if not, let's, let's not compromise  ourselves in that game and then in future games. We might, you know, might be a one off. That was a bullpen  game for the Dodgers. The Yankees, I think he was more pitchers than the Dodgers did and it was a bullpen game for them.  Now you got Garrett Cole. Garrett Cole. This is why you pay him all that money to win this game.  Biggest game of his Yankee career. Do you have momentum? We'll talk to John Smolts a little later on about that next hour.  Let me see Curtis and Illinois. Hi Curtis. What's on your mind today?  More DP. I got a possible poll question than a good old question. Ryan time for you. But for the poll question,  you guys were talking about like hardened being a whole thing in the best work and then with the  hop getting signed in the cheap last year.

I've done a lot of really cool things.  Like doing this show, right?  We've had a lot of really great opportunities.  That was one of the craziest rooms I've ever seen in my whole life where I would be Alfonso  Rivera talking to, you know, like Albert Puhlholtz and Aaron Rogers and you're like,  Oh my god, it's Steph Curry walks in.  And Miles Teller is standing over here.  Like, what the heck is?  And everybody was just chill.  They're having like a sandwich and drinking a beer and it was crazy.  Yeah, a lot of fun.  So it's awesome.  We got a great guest list today and any changes to that.  Well, let's, you know, where we're situated, just right off of the driving range.  And we may get some people showing up prior to team off today.  But that's the fun part of this.  All right.  So, Polk question today.  Yes, Paul.  The other funny thing is we're such dubs.  Me, Marvin, and the scene are sitting there.  And we're commenting on different celebrities.  We said, oh, there's Miles Teller.  We've never seen him for us.  And then he's me.  He can't just from SNL.  He's kind of jacked.  No, no.  He can't just.  He's in great shape, man.  He's he's gotten big.  Then we had to debate.  Seeing us.  If I were that famous in Mary, Discardler, Joe Hansen,  I put my feet up and just have a belly, I'm like, I'd be jacked too.  I'll just work out and stay in shape.  But I, I don't think I'd let myself go just because I got a  early Joe Hansen as my wife.  No, I'm just saying that is like, oh, hey, like you're on SNL.  And you got to really hot what?  You got to stay in great shape.  Not really.  You actually know you know.  That's her done.  You do that.  Good debate.  There are plenty of gorgeous women in here.  Like really?  Wow, that dude, man.  Keep yourself a shape.  I don't have to.  It's like the normal SEC couple.  Oh, yeah.  Like man, how did he get her?  Yeah, we went to that party after the party.  Yes.  It was more the one that the crazy room, the awesome room was like just players basically.  Yeah.  And then there was something where I think it was players and families and everything.  Yeah.  I bet you 60% of that crowd went to an SEC school.  I bet you just looking at there was like, oh, look, there's an Ole Miss polo shirt.  And that's an LSU one.  And that's what I bet you at least half of that crowd.  I saw the punky QB, Jim McMahon, and Jim a long time.  Got to talk to him.  He said some health issues, but he is still Jim McMahon.  He, you know, he's not the golfer that he once was.  He was a really good golfer.  I played around a golfer then, probably 20 years ago.  He was him and Bo Jackson.  And Mac is just a, he's a funny guy.  Now he plays barefoot.  They're making very huge shoes when he tees off.  And then he takes off his shoes and then he plays.  And then when he gets ready to come back to the 18th hole,  they have been put on his shoes.  And but he plays barefoot.  And I ran into a son.  His son should be jacked because he carries Jim McMahon's golf clubs.  And Jim McMahon, you know, his poor son, there's usually eight or nine beers in the golf bag with ice.  Just start his round.  And then he makes the turn and adds eight or nine beers and ice at the turn.  So I saw his son and I was out here in 2006 playing.  I said, you should be in better shape.  But he goes, what do you mean?  I go, you carry your dad's clubs with all that beer in there.  And he goes, no, we got a designated beer carrier this year.  He goes, I'm not going to carry the beer.  I'm carrying his clubs.  So it was fun last night.  Now these guys cleaned that I had an awkward moment.  Woo.  Okay.  And I certainly don't want to start anything with this.  I didn't intend to start anything with this.  And all of a sudden, I've got the damn ads.  Now Fritz, he's not here. He's still in London.  So it's Marvin, it's Paulian Seaton.  And all of a sudden, Marvin and Mario, who's the director of the show,  The eyes and ears of the show goes, man.  You just just brought your clemence.  I go, I didn't even see him.

I think they can win a playoff game?  No, no.  Will they?  No, no, no.  Of course they can.  They can play off first.  They haven't quinceed the playoffs yet.  Okay, if they make the playoffs, they'll win a playoff game.  They will.  Do I have to get a pie in the face though?  I can see them winning the play.  That's, can envision it.  I can picture them celebrating a wild card playoff game.  Way to go out on them.  Yeah.  They need a better pass rush.  They have a good second there.  They're winning the game.  We.

They tried to get cute there.  The Colts in a backfire.  They did.  They got tried to get cute too with their touchdown run.  Two.  And that backfire as well.  Already five interceptions.

That is much as you like, but early result pending.  Okay.  Fair enough.  Paulie has a pie to the face bet.  Yes.  Okay.  Team USA basketball.  Okay.  They're close up and to give five and a half points for the duration of the tournament.  And they win the gold.  And the closest game is not within five and a half points.  Good.  For a pie or some type of a pro American type of food product.  Pro American food products.  Or maybe something from the country.  Okay.  That does the indigenous to that country.  Cover the spread.  So I'm giving five and a half points in every game to the field.  No matter who they play or whom.  Does anybody want a piece of that?  Who's anti-American?  Who is?  So you would have to bet that they will.  You don't have to bet that they're not going to win the gold.  They just have to lose one game by five or less point.  No.  They have to not win one game.  Correct.  I'm putting the spread for every single game at USA giving five and a half points.  Okay.  Does anybody want a piece of that, then?  They're going to win every game.  Every game.  Yes.  Five and six or more.  Has to be six.  Yes.  To how do you look like you're ready to take the chance?  I think they should be able to win by least six points.  I think I'll even go surprise to say a conspiracy theory that they were kind of taking it easy  and getting other countries a little overconfident watching some of these two  upgames and they're going to turn it on and go to the next level.  Oh, team USA is beatable.  Look at this.  They've barely got by and then all of a sudden once we get started in accounts, it's going to be a whole  of the story.  Okay.  So Todd is on your side, Paulie, but you could take the other side and bet against what you were  betting for if you bet against Tom.  I actually believe what I'm saying in this junction.  Oh, it's supposed to be usual.  Okay.  I'm with Team Todd.  Marvin, I want to piece of this.  As a matter of fact, I don't.  Okay.

I think Andrew and I had a big bet on that one. What was the bet with you in McLevin?  Menta Tael going in the first round maybe. I think it's the first 15 and a half. Maybe.  Maybe. Oh, yeah. Maybe for 15. Something like that. Once again, I filled out my Heisman ballot yesterday  and we saw the results as far as the candidates going to New York. The last five times there were no S.E.C.

Bryce love year where I don't think  I got from the SEC. The other player was Lamar Jackson, 2017. That's a blue, blue for Paul.  2016 had happened. It also included Lamar Jackson and Baker Mayfield.

That makes you think a whole lot more than that guy coming off the side.  Because you can step up in the pocket.  When you got the guy who comes up the middle.  Because I never looked at Aaron Donald's sack totals or even Jalen Carter.  He didn't have a sack.  I don't think.  Doesn't matter.  He took two guys every single play.  Great.  You know, it's like, hello to not a like those guys who were just there.  And you got to deal with them.  And Jalen Carter.  He was wonderful.  And in fact, at one point during the regular season, I said, he might be their most valuable player,  which sounds crazy with, but say, Juan did and then Jalen hurts as well.  But when you have that guy and nobody else has a guy like that.  I don't think if there's any other team that has a guy like Jalen Carter.  His age, that ability, able to disrupt, got him on a rookie contract.  Yeah.  Going to be formidable.  Let's see here.  Luke and Charlotte.  Hi, Luke.  What's on your mind today?  Hey, Dan.  Well, I had a rough, rough, vetting day on Sunday for one night.  My little two-pick parlay Jalen hurts first touch down.  Which was a bit of a roller coaster between it again.  I just thought, I just thought, oh, now I just got to wait for the entire day for Travis Kelsky to score it.  And it didn't happen.  But then also Travis Kelsky did not score off the field.  So I'm here to humbly ask Marvin what flavor pie I need to take.  Alright.  Marvin had a bet with Luke and Charlotte.  What flavor pie?  Just take what the classics.  We just go blue there.  Blueberry pie.  And then you'll send us the video, Luke.  Yep.  I got Tyler's email and all all descended in this week.  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  I look forward to that.  I think there's a couple of bets to be paid off here.  Marvin, you're a way to pie to the face.  I am.  Okay.  When would you like said pie to the face?  When it's warm?  Because if you think I'm going outside and taking a pie.  You want the pie warm or you want the weather warm?  Oh, the weather warm.  Doug and North Carolina.  Good morning Doug.  What's on your mind today?  Well, Dan yesterday, you guys asked the question.  Who had the worst weekend?  And you nominated Nick Wright in my homes.  And I think Taylor Swift.  I think there's somebody you guys are forgetting about.  And that's Pat Riley.  Who I did know this until this year.  But I guess in the ADC copy wrote the phrase free peat.  And he had a deal on the table with the chief.  Yeah.  That would have given him a percentage of any merchandise sold.  He lost millions upon.  He's from Doc.  Like it's yesterday.  And he wasn't even at the game.  I think he has to be in consideration.  But he also was able to trade away Jimmy Butler.  So I'm going to guess that maybe it even down for Pat Riley.  Finally got rid of Jimmy Buckets.  Bryant in Virginia.  Hi Bryant.  What's on your mind?  Hey, D.P.  Going to be back on.  I actually come to you today with another title for Fritz C.

Denver plays Dallas this weekend.  I am not a Dallas fan,  but I am a fan of content.  Uh,  If Denver wins,  I'll take a pie to the face.  If Dallas wins,  you have to go see the spring scene by o pick  and prove to everyone that you saw it somehow.  Wow.  So no pie to the face,  but I need a ticket stunt.  Well, I would need a timestamp that you're going to be there  through the entire movie.  Are you open to a bet with your broncos against the Cowboys?  Yes.  Let's do that.  Okay.  All right, Sean.

Well,  I have three musicians like the Johnny Cash and so forth.  I know Rahmi Malick won the Academy Award.  But he didn't sing Freddie Mercury.  He lived sing Freddie Mercury.  That, who was it?  Terran Edgeron Edgerton, who did the Elton John biopic?  He actually sang Elton John.  And had that come out before the Queen biopic.  then he might have gotten nominated for an Academy Award.  But Romney Malick was just lip-sinking and put in,  you know, prosthetic teeth, and he got into Academy Award.  Jeremy Allen White, from the bear, I think he sings all the songs there in the moving.  And it's based off of the album, Nebraska, which is a pretty dark album when you think about it.  But they did a movie or bite me.  That's where you hear Academy Award and Bos Oscar Bos.

That's why you have teams two or three teams every year that go.  We're going to make that really big leap here.  Like Green Bay did.  Detroit has.  San Francisco's been there.  But you know, that's the true greatness is when Kansas City has a first place schedule.  And they're still there every single year.  No matter what.  And I don't know.  It feels that way again.  Like who's going against Kansas City in the AFC this year?  Is anybody like are you all in on that the Texans feel like the Green Bay Packers,  where you're like man.

If I lose a bat all four of you simultaneously could be in the face of the pot.  Okay.  The Lions win the Super Bowl.  We win the Sports Emmy.  Okay.  That's it.

All right.  Yeah.  We're not win.  I will too.  Two leg parlay.  Anybody out.  Todd here.  So nobody thinks we're going to win the Sports Emmy just Pauling.  Wait.  Who has it?  I have a chance.  Yes.  We win the Sports Emmy or the Lions.  Why?  Positive of one of those two things.  We're not winning the Sports Emmy.  Okay.  I can see it to try to hold it up to Lamar.  It's right there.

But everybody took the bet.  You guys.  Yeah.  Not to.  Yeah, I got that one.  We were willing to do it on us winning the Sports Emmy.  Let it on.  The Lions win in the Super Bowl.  I don't think I'd like the Lions maybe learn something from last year.  And like, you know what I was saying?  Yeah.  Don't blow a 20 to 70 lead.  But they maybe they won't do that.  You know.

You didn't want to give up anything for Kevin Durant. You're going to give up a lot  for Jalen Brown. You're going to give up Thompson. You're going to give up a couple of your young  stars and I wouldn't do that. Jalen Brown, wonderful player and maybe maybe Brooklyn would be the team  that I would at least have a conversation.

Yeah, he joins Jim Caldwell and Steve Mary Uchi.  But Caldwell took over for Tony Dungey with those great coldsteams and Mary Uchi took over the Niners team.  So this is different.  New England wasn't any good last year.  And they are really good this year.  Now, 10 game winning streak.  And, you know, I do tell the audience, watch an entire game.  You're going to get a true sense of a player, a team, a coach, an environment, all of those things.  And that's why these standalone games we overreact.  It's because we didn't watch them play.  If the Patriots were playing the Giants at 1 o'clock on Sunday,  very few people would have this referendum on Drake May or Mike Rabel.  It's a standalone game.  You're watching.  Now all of a sudden you go, man, Mike Rabel's really good.  Man, Drake May is really good.  Yes.  Yes.  But it does help putting it in context when you watch  an entire game.  Dylan and San Diego.  Hi, Dylan.  What's on your mind today?  Hey, what's up, D.P.  I got a couple of things for you.  I got a good friend that is an Indianapolis Colt fan.  And be it that I am a Jaguar's fan, Marvin,  by the face that you owe me.  He spells his name, D.I. L.O. and I spell it D.I. L.A. and we're constantly arguing about this.  So I'm hoping that you can settle this for me this week.  Marvin, do you owe a pie to the face to Dylan?  I don't remember he's a refresh my memory.  Oh, the Jags.  Eight wins.  It was seven and a half wins.  The over under.  Oh, I'm not.  The Jags hit that nice eighth win this weekend.  You know what, D.I. L.A. and we're going to have the I team look into that.  But thank you for the phone calling.  We have a Dylan here and that's D.I. L.A.  And so I'm going to side with that.  And of course I love Bob Dylan D.I. L.A. and even though his name is Bobby Zimmerman.  Yes, Paul.  Damn, we're going to find out about that bet in a moment.  But D.I. L.A. L.A. is a wealth mythology.  And I mean, son of the sea, D.I. L.O.N. is Irish and English means you throw a loyal or faithful.  Hmm.  We can't go wrong with either.  Right.  I kind of, I don't know.  I think I like a D.I. L.A. and a little bit more.  I'm partial to that as well.  Thank you, Dylan.  Thank you, Dylan.  Thank you, Dylan.  All right. We'll come back.  We'll get to more phone calls here and our play of the day next.

"Fri, 10 Jan 2025","Hour 1 – Notre Dame Advances, Chris Fowler",38:28,Todd Fritz,Other,Pie,Todd bets that the Broncos beat the Bills.,Other,Todd Fritz,Paid,2025-03-21,"Okay.  Okay.  So, here's a little way, man.  Could we do the intro for who stats would you want?  Alrighty.  Alright, this rookie QB had 381 passing yards, Drake May.  22 TDs and 13 Interceptions.  No, that's not Drake May.  This rookie QB had 2800 yards, 11 TDs and 10 Interceptions.  And the last rookie QB had 226 yards, 15 touchdowns and 10 Interceptions.  Which QB would you choose, Dan?  I think you would probably choose the first one, wouldn't you?  Yes.  That is a good choice.  That was Matt Jones in 2021.  The second one was Bryce Young last year and the last one was Drake May this year.  My point is this.  It matters who's your offensive coordinator as a rookie QB.  And so, if they bring in Mike Brable to the Patriots, I don't think Drake may  make it grow.  Because Mike Brable doesn't show that he develops quarterbacks.  But Josh McDaniels was Matt Jones in 2021, had the best season.  Yeah, but you can always bring in Josh McDaniels.  I don't think he's working.  So, Brable can bring him in.  I don't think.  I mean, I would.  I don't think Brable goes in and says, boy, I can develop a quarterback.  I mean, Ryan Tannahill developed in Tennessee and do a pretty good quarterback.  Yeah.  Let me see if he gets the job and be who is offensive coordinator is going to be.  Jake and Buffalo.  Hey, Jake, what's on your mind?  Hey, Dan.  I was calling to see if Todd was confident enough in his brocos this weekend to shock the world and beat  the bills for a pie to the face.  But if you need any incentive, I saw that this morning that Sean Peyton is 30 and 12 against  Paul had coaches since 2017 and Sean McZermit is very bald.  Okay, this is straight up bet.  Todd, I don't know.  I think you've already spoken your your piece on this.  I think I have a pie in the bet going already with somebody.  I couldn't double down, I guess.  But this is straight up.  Yeah, if it gets fair, what is what's your opinion?  Well, you don't want to win a bet if your team gets, you know, they you cover the spread.  True.  Not in the playoffs.  All right, let's call it.  Alex takes down Josh Allen.  Marco's a bit.  I like it.  I like it.  All right, Jake, you got a bet with Fritzzy.  Broncos, going to shock the world.  They're eight and a half point underdogs according to draft Kings this morning.  Aiden in Utah.  I ate in what's on your mind today.  Hey, D.P.  Al the hockey club.  We have a winning record.  The winning is team and franchise history.  That's not the price.  I was going to call.  I got.  You just gave me another talk to talk to you about Todd.  You get bullied into being a Broncos fan to stay with your chest.  I'll just back away.  You always get to have to talk you in to being a Broncos fan.  What are we doing?  Are they you work this or you're not?  I'm completely with the Broncos since I was like seven years old in 1977.  But that's asking a lot for the Broncos to beat the bills in Buffalo.  But I'm still taking Denver.  I just made a pie in the face bet that they're going to win outright and go Broncos.  Let's see what happens at the Highmark Stadium in the state of New York.  Wow.  If I was to play or you were my coach, I'd run through all after that.  That was inspirational.  Yes, Marvin.  Get up.  Come on.  I'm ready to run through a wall.  Yeah.  All right.  Get some more phone calls coming up next hour.  Bill Cower is going to join us.  Little later on.  We'll talk to the very colorful Arizona state head football coach.  Kenny Dillingham.  Bill Jonas.

And I don't know why I'm like, I'm like, what the hell's going up for some reason?  And then my Twitter goes up and I start to think everything.  Charles Barkley said he couldn't think of a trade this monumental in his lifetime.  And I was like, we've been around the game forever.  Is this the biggest trade in the history of the NBA and will we ever make sense of it?  Or do we have to measure it in NBA championships as per it to ever make sense?  You believe I have a great week for what's there.  Thank you, Gus.  I don't know if we'll measure this in championships.  But I think we're going to look and get the full story on this eventually.  Like why did they, why are they moving on from him?  He's 25.  Was it that he wasn't buying into getting in shape?  Was there anything that happened behind the scenes?

Three years ago he passed away.  I'm talking about active celebrities who were supporting South Florida bulls.  But thank you, Mikey.  Yes, Newton.  Let's say it doesn't Gallagher is at him or his brother.

What do you think about how about them cowboys there, Shay?  No, Danny.  Danny, you know, this reminds me of the time I quit drinking.  In the way I did is I just got into benzos.  I accomplished my original goal of what did it cost me in the end.  You know?  A lot.  That's a gambler.  That has a fellow degenerate.  I stand with Jerry on this game.  But it is a huge gamble, Danny.  And this is God's judgment for trading a mori.  This is what they get.  What are benzos?  Oh, you know, Danny, Danny Fortboard.  Baby the latter.  Oh, okay.  God, what are we doing?  But you don't do any of that anymore.  I just want to put that out there.  No, Danny, I tell you what you get into those.  You'll lose three, four days in a row.  And just you're gone.  All right.  Well, Jerry said he was going to make some moves.  He was all in.  Maybe make some trades.  You got George Pickins in a contract case.  Yeah.  In a rental.  It's a one year rental.  And you're asking a first year head coach to keep it all copicetic.  It's a huge gamble.  But they had to do something, Danny.  I was standing with Jerry.  What it comes to game.  But I have to.  I think the over under seven and a half wins for the Cowboys.  Oh, okay.  Hey, we're.  All right.  Go.  Will the Cowboys make the playoffs?  Not a one.  Oh, yeah.  Have you bet there, Danny.  All right.  Thanks for calling in.  Yeah, whatever.  All right.  That's Shay and Irving.  These sounds rough for a guy who doesn't drink or do anything anymore.  He sounds pretty rough.  Yes, Pauli.  I was hoping he'd say they make the playoffs.  I was ready.  I was ready.  I was jumping in on that as well.  I'll go.  I'll put 500 against him.  Shay wants to call back in.  500 that the Cowboys don't make the playoffs.  Okay.  If you want it.  Okay.  Is it gambling?  He is part of the gambling podcast.  Shay let me know.  Call back in.  If you want to take Pauli up on the bed.  He'll bet you $500.  The Cowboys will not make the playoffs.  So maybe we can reach out to.  Sure.  I jumped in on that with Pauli.  Maybe I'll split the 100.  Okay.  We did 250.  We caught that.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll get to phone calls.  Let's set a one of Pauli questions here first.  We'll check in with the Steelers coming up at the top of the hour.  What do you have for me?  Okay.  Let's see.  Does anyone understand what Dan just said to Todd?  Yes.  Okay.  Oh, wait.  That's the wrong Pauli question.  Sorry about that.  I'm going to lose.  Fred, see the rest of the show.  No.  I talked by and you put your head down.  You didn't want to talk to me.  I dropped something.  Yeah.  That's the exact time you're going to walk in.  Okay.  I'm going to stay in on the X and see.  I must have spilled some.  Okay.  I'm going to believe you.  I think you're telling me the truth.  Actually not.  I just give you the cold shoulder.  I know that.  That's funny.  I know that.  All right.  See what he had.  Sovereignty skipping the pre-kness is smart or soft.  I don't even understand why it's smart.  Unless there's something wrong with the horse.  This is horse racing needs this.  We get excited when the hat in the possibility of a triple crown.  It always happens.  You know, as soon as the derbies over where like.  All right.  What's the possibility?  You know, was it a long shot?  Therefore they're not going to win on, you know,  a different track.  Different distance.  In like the Belmont.  They're waiting for the Belmont.  The Belmont's going to be in Sarah Togo.  It's not even going to be at the Belmont.  So you got the pre-knis, not going to do the pre-knis.  It doesn't feel like it should be an unwritten rule  that if you win the Derby, you're going to go for the triple crown.  I think that's the problem. It is an unwritten rule.  It doesn't research on this this morning.  It's sovereignty on Tuesday,  before the pre-knis spets even started,"

Yeah, they are.  Yeah, that seems to be a consensus thing. But that's not their fault.  It's our fault. It's the media's fault. They're good. Therefore, they're going to be talked about.  You know, now Mahomes is getting into the Tom Brady conversation or maybe the Michael Jordan conversation.  Andy Reed now getting into the Bill Belichon conversation. Now we're looking at them as  is this the best run we've seen in the NFL in history. Yes, yes, I do. I also like, how can  you not root for Andy Reed? I don't think I haven't met anyone who doesn't like him. He's the franchise  wins leader for both of these teams in the Super Bowl. Like, that's pretty cool. I don't think that's  ever happened. Has it? Look at you. Don't some research for change. I know I didn't have to read that one,  too. Yeah. I don't know.

It'd be like longest active coaches Bill Belichon, they Marvin Lewis. Let me see,  Chuck and Ronnie. I Chuck, what's on your mind? Good morning, Dan and Dan F. And I just a little bit of  a best and worst of Dylan this week. If you well, the best being his grateful day, steal your face,  sweatshirt, hoodie, the other day. And that'll work. But I think he needed some more air times,  some more opportunity, which has seemingly gotten better in the week for grasses. And hopefully we'll get  his best bets. And on the Super Bowl next week down in New Orleans, something if you're going to bet  Billy Way or Kansas City Way and then some prop bets and speaking of prop bets, got a pie in the face  bet for a fritzy prop down in New Orleans. So a fritzy miss-hap pie in the face that's something  and nothing in Jerry. So we don't want fritzy to get hurt. But a stubby of the toe or some kind of  maybe getting lost in the city. The fritzy miss-hap pie in the bit pie in the face, but in a minute,  double down, double or nothing. It's going to be like cocky has upper body or lower body injuries very  big. But fritzy miss-hap upper body New Orleans next week. Who's there? All right, yes Paul. Yeah,  fritzy will not be leaving the hotel that often and going out on the streets of New Orleans. However,  I think last year you'd get hurt in his hotel room. Oh, that's right. I did out of the  half of him like two in the morning. I didn't know but that little dead couch thing that they have in front of  the bed where you sit and tie your shoes or whatever that's for and I went flying. I know it's hard to believe  some of my sides could actually like take, you know, be airborne. But I went flying and I banged my toe  was terrible. God, I would love to have video. Bruce to ankle and like, I pay a thousand dollars right now for  video of that. Pitch black in the room. I don't know the TV on or anything. There was maybe a little  nightlight but too far for me to see what I feel bad for the person underneath you, the room underneath  you and they heard you. So I get gah, earth guy, sky's falling. You don't have earthquakes this  part of the country. That's odd. I wish you call the front desk. I don't know if you want video of thoughts  of towering that bed. Well, he's described his hotel room to me and in great detail. But I would love to have  seen that. Are you naked? Oh, I know I'm just saying that. I'm sorry. I'm a journalist. I don't  know what I'm saying. At times I'll take an up and put like a towel down and just with my socks. No,  what I'm saying, where you naked when I got out of bed.

I just wanted to comment on the Celtics.  Someone can tell them not to shoot three.  It's like, I think it was Paul excited that they took last game.  It felt like the same amount.  I mean, there was a play where they like...  Oh, no.  No, no.  We got it, Grant.  Oh, my bad.  It's a little bit like it hung up on my thing.  I think it was Paul excited that they took last last game.  But there was a play where they liked stole the ball and threw a holiday step back and took it  through even someone else's left and then Jalen Brown's left left one.  He faded, but like they don't have to do that.  It's not like there's no wall that says, hey, take every three.  Potentially can.  One of them found to go in.  But this is who they are.  They're not changing.  They average 48 three pointers attempted a game.  And the next, no this.  Their defense, really their game plan.  Their scheme is predicated on the Celtics are going to take those three's.  If they want to go inside, if they want to get to the next or probably going to let them,  or probably not impede them the way, you know, you just don't want them to get hot from three point  range.  Because if they do, then you're going to get blown out.  But even if they get warm from three point range, you could be in trouble.  Turbo in Buffalo.  I turbo what's on your mind.  Oh, hey, damn, I'm on an honor.  Yeah, I want to talk about, um,  I'm going to respond to your poll question, Celtics is six.  They're going to win for an role.  I think you know it.  I think other people know it.  I don't know it.  I don't know it.  I try not to know it all because we get into, you know, dangerous hot takes when we do that.  Yes, feet.  So maybe what I'll do for the poll question is Nixon seven or Celtics and six.  We'll give Nixon the entire series to win, but Celtics have to win for an  role.  I think Turbo wanted a pie bet, pie to the face bet that the Celtics were going to win the next four.  You know, when somebody says somebody doesn't have a chance.  I would go, no, they have a chance.  If you play in a game, play in a sporting event, you have a chance.  Never say somebody doesn't have a chance.  So many people jump to the, this will be a gentleman's sweep,  Boston will win the next four.  Well, those are probably casual basketball fans who are just dropping in and going,  hey, I guess I got to have a take on this and then they tell you, yep, Celtics will win in five.  I'd love to know what you're saying on your show today or what you're writing today or what your  hot take today.  Celtics are winning for an arrow.  Can they?  Yes.  But would I bet on it?  No, I bet against it.  I think the next will get at least one at home.  Now I still think Boston will win.  I think that's that's the unique part of these best of seven series, the best team wins.  If this is March madness, the Celtics are out.  Minnesota is out.  Cleveland is out.  Okay, see is out.  But it's not March madness.  It's a best of seven.  Jason in Florida.  Hi, Jason.  What's on your mind?  Hey, I didn't hear you.  Great, great.  Jason.  Hey, so I decided a question for you.  So I just came back yesterday from the Metallica concert at Virginia Tech and as you know,  the Inter-Sandman as their hype song and I was wondering what do you think which university  has the best free game hype song or tradition?  I would have to look at the list of different songs with different schools because everybody has  won a hype song either before the game, some have it going into the fourth quarter, but yeah, Metallica  did Inter-Sandman and Virginia Tech, that's their football song.  Their hype song.  But did Virginia Tech do that before Mariano Rivera?"

I think they might tell yeah  I think I think  Does anybody want the the under that they don't get married  Once again keep in mind waiting cake to the face yeah  I like that series. Are you waiting for you?  I'm gonna take a wedding cake to the face that Taylor Swift and Travis Kelsey don't get married Todd  I will ask this question.

I'm gonna say then not gonna be alright. I'll take the wedding cake to the face  All right  All right, let's vote here  Because  Todd said hey, it's good content that he would take a part of the phase, but that's not the first time I brought this up on the show  I think I brought it up another time, but I do talk about wedding and then at the very end saying I need an engagement  Marvin should Todd take a wedding cake to the face  No, all  Not yet, but he could get it over with now. Seaton definitely  I think that you mocked me and I say yes  Todd, what do you think wedding cake to the face? I think based on hearing that we have to wait and see how it plays out over the next two and a half years and then if they get once they get married then  I take the wedding cake to the face but they actually have to walk down the island. It's about double or nothing  What's the double or nothing?  That if they get married you take two cakes  You're already planning on three like I entire wedding cake at me. Wait like two full cakes  Yes, we went from like a piece of pie or a piece of cake to two full cakes  Two and a half years a long time  I'm probably not going to go double or nothing but I think we need to see others plays out and see if they actually  Go through it and exchange them out. Yes, what if you made Todd have to eat the whole cake  Rather than wear it what do you mean making?  Yes, I would for me if you have to you have to eat the entire cake like throughout the course of one show  You'll give them three hours. He has to try and eat the entire cake  You want to do that  That would have to be after the jack to off November F1 contest that was supposedly right you guys are supposed to be eating a jack hey  I'm supposed to just have like yogurt and cottage anybody started the jack off contest  Is it officially on well I thought you guys were getting in shape for Vegas because beautiful people be there for  Formia to one and we were calling it the jack to jack to off yeah  Come to it.

It's the most emasculating thing in my life.  Anyway, that's it.  Okay.  But does that bother you as a picture?  What that hit or did yesterday in the elimination game in the college world.  Sirs.  It does not at all.  I can see it on both sides for sure.  No, I mean, there's two sides of the history.  One, you do not want to be on for every no hit or imperfect game.  Somebody was a massive failure.  All right.  Well, thank you, do.  I agree.  Now, if there was a game today that yesterday wasn't an elimination.  And that guy came to the plate against an Arkansas pitcher.  Then you might buzz the tower there.  Now, I don't know if they have unwritten rules in college the way they do.  And you know, Major League Baseball.  Here's another thing that it doesn't happen very often.  But when it does, it's pretty exciting.  It's when somebody goes from pitching in the college world series or playing in the world series.  And then they go right to the Major League.  It doesn't happen very often.  And why is that with baseball?  Whereas in basketball, you could be one in done and go you're in the NBA the next year.  Now, you have guys who have gone from that didn't play minor league.  They didn't play minor league baseball.  They've been filled in Bob Horner a couple of guys that come to mind.  But somebody who had this momentum and you've gone, all got that guy was lights out the world series.  What happened to him?  Oh, he's down in AA and then you don't see him for four or five years.  They lose that.  Oh, I watched that guy in March madness and he's going to be playing in the NBA.  Or I watched this guy in the college football playoffs.  And he's going to be starting it for my team at quarterback.  Yes, Mark.  I'm going to leave a couple of guys that I can remember that was in the college world series.  And they became Major League players.  Steven Straussburg was hot for a second in Paul Schenz, but other than that, I really can't think of the top of my head.  Anybody in that spot.  Dave in Washington.  Hi, Dave.  What's on your mind today?  Morning, D.P.  Danette.  How you doing?  Good.  Good.  So I think we got a little pie to the face here for Fritzzy.  I, I don't know that Fritzzy could stay in the box to face a curve ball at that speed.  Let alone, you know, be able to get out of the way.  Well, we took batting practice when we were out at the Super Bowl in Arizona.  And we were at the Giants Spring Training site.  And they set up the pitching machine.  And they're probably, you know, it might have been 80.  We had him, I think, bring it up to 90.  And Fritzzy hung in there.  Fritzzy had some good hacks.  But I mean, it's different with a live game.  The ball is kind of going straight.  Although you could make it curve.  Make it dip, make it do a lot of different things.  But basically it was probably 85 to 90 miles an hour.  And Fritzzy was staying in there.  I mean, nobody puts on a, like a grimace.  The way.  Like, shot it.  You know, where he's chopping it down the third baseline.  But you did pretty well.  I took it very seriously.  I don't know.  I've had this angry face.  Like I had to prove I can get some hits with that.  See, would you update the pole results from the first tower?  I'd be happy to do this a very specific poll quest.  Very heavy.  Uh, yeah.  We've got up there right now.  Should the Mary State hit her down three runs in the eighth inning of a college world series  Eliminational game, done more to help gauge wood of Arkansas get a perfect game?  Yeah.  Right now.  Let's see.  We've got many more votes now.  Uh, 93.2% say no.  Okay.  6.8 are saying yes.  Okay.  All right, Todd.  So you got a couple of fans there.  Apple.  Yeah.  Hang in there.  Fritzzy says, uh, hey, somebody sent me a tweet.  Said you're the man, Fritzzy.  And then he goes, I just got another tweet.  Fritzzy, you're soft in need.  Like I subtracted these food.  Yeah.  All righty.  What hour in the books?"

A little bit earlier, you talked about that.  The NCAA is waiting for Congress to do something for them.  Yeah.  Is that like the blinding the blinding?  Yeah.  More dysfunctional than the NCAA is US Congress.  That's.  Thank you, Mike.  I can only tell you what I've been told.  That college football.  It's one of those where you go.  What happened?  You know, it's like you wake up after a long night of drinking and you kind of surveyed  the situation.  You're like, what happened here?  It feels like that's college football.  What happened here?  Now you need somebody to clean it up.  You need a, you need a fixer to come in.  Yeah, Paul.  I remember we came in the day after it man's cell was on the cover of Time Magazine.  Maybe 2012, time to pay college athletes.  We were discussing, we're like, it's going to be at least five or six more years or seven.  And we thought it'd be like some type of minimum wage to perform in your sport.  We really did.  I remember that show.  And then it went from zero to a thousand.  Oh, zero to millions.  Yeah.  Yeah.

All right.  We'll have a poll question.  Play the day, stat of the day.  All of that coming up.  Chargers came back to beat the Broncos.  The chargers did something that's uncharger like.  They came back and they won this game, a close game.  And they're now 9 and 6.  Denver is 9 and 6.  And if you start to look at what the rest of the regular season looks like, the Broncos got  a really big game at the Bengals.  And then they host the cheves and the Broncos can only hope that that game against the cheves  doesn't mean anything for the cheves.  Maybe Carson went since the starting quarterback, not Patrick Mahomes.  Now the chargers.  The chargers next to game at the Patriots and at the Raiders.  And they won both games against Denver these years.  So they won the tiebreaker.  Todd has to take a bite of the face later on today.  And where this shirt, what most fun chargers shirt.  You got your Justin Herbert football is fun t-shirt on.  If I pass out with some reason, it's not because I'm upset about the loss.  It's because the shirt is so tight that I'm losing blood supply to vital organs.  Did that ever fit?  So put it on this morning with the never fit.

How many wins is he away from surpassing Don Schula on the all time victory list?  That's the only thing I'm curious about with Bellachack and I don't know how important it is for Bellachack to have the most wins in NFL history.  I think he's widely considered the greatest coach in NFL history.  Yes, John.  I'm looking at Don Schula 347 Bill Bellachack 333, which would be 14.  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  I'm tired.  So 14.  So he needs 15 wins.  He could have had that the last four years if he had a decent team.  Satan.  How can you?  How can that not be a factor?  That's something that literally takes your entire career to get to that level and now you're less than a full season away  from it that that wouldn't bother you.  I don't know.  It's Bill Bellachack.  I don't know how he's wired.  I don't know if that's important to him.  I know Don Schula had some critical things to say about Bellachack and cheating scandals.

"Fri, 30 May 2025","Hour 2 - Low Expectations for the Cowboys, Cory Alexander",36:20,Paulie Pabst,Dan Patrick,Pie,Paul bets that the college basketball tournament will not expand.,Dan Patrick,Paulie Pabst,Paid,2025-06-26,"You might see 72 to 76 teams in the field.  There are conversations going on right now with the NCAA and also their TV partners,  which includes CBS.  And that would be expanding the tournament, which is something that I told you about a while ago  that I'd gotten word that they might go to 76,  but they probably would do 72 and then the next step would be to go to 76.  They're always going to add, they'll never subtract.  There's so much money at stake.  That's why when people were kicking and screaming about going from national title games  and now having four teams in there to now you have 12.  They got to 12.  They were like, why don't we get to 16?  Because everybody realized that there's billions of dollars at stake here.  And that's what everybody is trying to find a chair to sit.  When the music stops, you want to have a chair to sit and you go, okay, we're going to be able to make money.  The SEC, I could see the SEC, now it's not going to happen, but I could see the SEC saying  to the rest of college football.  You know what does have our own league?  The heck with you guys.  But just do it.  We'll keep all the money that we make and we're the best league people want to watch us.  And if you don't let us get a certain number of schools into the playoffs.  I mean, Greg Sanky, you'll probably join us next week, the commissioner of the SEC.  I mean, he's trying to be very pragmatic about this, but he also has to be fair to, you know, his teams to his conference.  We got the best conference.  Why are you going to limit the number of teams that we can have in here?  Shouldn't we get an automatic whatever it is?  And I think that's where we're headed with college football that you're going to go to a 16 team playoff schedule coming up in 2026.  And I think they're going to expand March badness as well.  Yeah, Paul.  I have a quick pie to the face bet off the possible NCA basketball expansion.  Whoa.  I'm going to say it will not happen when we do this show.  Let's say a year from today.  It still has been not been approved and they're all not be a expansion of the college basketball tournament.  Is anybody want a piece of that?  Pied with face expansion.  It will not be expanding.  I don't say.  So the side of the bet we would have to take is that it will expand.  Yeah, and that would expect it to.  I think the sentiment is against it and the networks are not going to come to an agreement.  I just think it means more play in games that first four, like you just load up those first two like Tuesday and Wednesday.  You just load them up.  Nobody's going to go all too many games at the start.  I mean, the only people who would complain is when you fill out your brackets, do you have to fill out your brackets and include those games as well.  I think people are fine with it.  It's just, you know, but a couple extra teams and a couple extra games.  I don't see any downside to it.  Now, I didn't want it to expand to this many to begin with.  I'd still like it to have, you know, a certain number that, you know, it's hard to get in.  It's hard to win.  Now everybody gets in.  But I think they'll expand.  I don't know if they'll expand next year, but they will, by the time we're done with this show, I think they will have gotten to 72 if not 76.  By the way, we're going to slide into the weekend and that's brought to you by King Soyane.  They want you to welcome Summer and Sliders Perfect.  We haven't sliders today for our brunch, our meat, Friday.  Get ready for Summer, grilling season.  Go to the bakery or Delhi, section of your local grocery store and pick up the irresistible King Soyane roles and Slider buns.  And enjoy.

Yeah, I just think an easier path for Tampa Bay.  I have to factor that in.  They have been consistent the last what four years, five years.  They won their division.  And I mean, they want to gain last night that I didn't think they were going to.  Banged up offensive line, but Baker may field.  Did a great job leading the team down to victory.  And here is Baker after the game.  These two minute close games.  We were not on the right side of things for the past couple years.  And it's going to see that we haven't even played close to our best ball in all three phases.  And we're still finding ways to win on the road.  And that's really important.  It is to not lose sight of that.  We're finding ways to win.  But also we do need to get things fixed.  Some of these games can make it easier on ourselves.  And try and put teams way earlier.  But this is a good team that we played.  So it's we expected an hard fought battle.  Yeah.  It's nice to be in the right side.  Fifth consecutive year, Tampa is open up the season.  Two and a long, as active streak in the NFL.  What other poll questions?  Putting up there right now, the AFC team that two and a no that won't make the playoffs.  Your options.  Their bills charge their bingles.  Colts.  Two and a no team that won't make the playoffs from the AFC.  I'll say the bingles there.  I do believe in the Colts.  I mean, the Colts could have made the playoffs last year.  I think it's a talented team.  I know we want to look at Daniel Jones and say, you're not going to make the playoffs with him.  I think he just has to do enough.  He got a really good running back.  You got skill position.  I think they're sneaking.  Now, I'm not saying they're a great team or they're going to be dangerous in the postseason.  But I do think they have a playoff caliber roster.  Yes, Todd.  And how do you score on your first 10 possessions with the season?  I find that amazing that they got at least a few.  Go the first 10 times they touched the ball.  Well, it also helped.  They were playing against the Broncos.  There's a weekend.  By the way, Todd gets a pie to the face at the end of the show.  That I do.  I don't know what kind of pie.  I left that up to the back room.  Guys, unless you requested something after your Broncos lost to the.  I did not.  I'm just going to let it randomly find out later on.  What it is.  Dylan just sent me the Super Bowl odds for the chargers in the  Buck and ears after last night.  Who do you think has better Super Bowl odds?  This is according to draft Kings.  If you said the chargers you would be right.  Plus 1600 the Buck and ears plus 2000.  Woo!  Oh, start of a day.  Start of a day.  Start of a day.  Start of a day.  This is the start of a day.  A lot of chatter today about Tom Brady being in the coaches booth last night with the  Raiders lost.  They're not even hiding.  I mean, it's right there.  It's like Tom.  Part owner and you're allowed to sit in there and help ship Kelly and his staff.  Albert Brear, money morning quarterback.  Send out a tweet.  People think of just the strategic stuff.  But it goes deeper than that.  You can also gather pertinent detail on players in production meetings to inform free  agents, signings and trades or figure out who the key assistant coaches are and try to  coach them.  Lots of layers to this with Tom Brady and his role at Fox and as a minority owner of the Raiders.  James Palmer.  He says that Tom Brady meets with Chip Kelly two to three times a week to go over film and go through  a game plan and every weekend, Brady is calling a game for Fox gathering as much information  as possible from players and coaches from both teams to be at his best in the broadcast.

But first, I have an MMW GOTW must most must win game of the week.  Mine is going to be the C-Hox at the Cardinals.  You look at that division.  The NFC West is only, you know, two games away from the Niners at the bottom to the C-Hox at the top.  You know, the Cardinals are given the C-Hox.  Two and a half points.  Yet the C-Hox beat them in week 12, 16 to six.  So I think that really says which team is going to win that division.  So that's my MMW GOTW.  Dan 2 questions for you.  One, you know, did a car come up with sand there for all of your appearances in his movies.  And two, maybe a quick, hot, five minute hot poll.  More in character on set in a suit.  You or Joe Pesci.  Hmm.  Yeah, I don't want to bring Joe into this.  Yeah.  He stands alone.  I just got back into my sports center days.  They put a mustache on me and I, that's all it is.  You get locked in.  That is truly like riding a bike.  When you sit there in the chair, you got a suit and tie on and you got your lines on promptor and you're just reading promptor.  That's all it was.  And I mean, there's some magic there obviously.  But, uh, no, it's fun.  Because samler sits all the way in the back.

And now it's, yeah, he's not a whole favor, but, yeah,  you find these receivers have about a five-year stretch,  where they were great.  It's just hard to sustain that.  At that position, where you go, oh my gosh, that guy lights out for five years.  And then after that, you end up in another team,  start to trail off a little bit here,  and that's what happened to Stefan Diggs.  Any got injured as well.  All right, we'll get to some phone calls here coming up.  8773D P-Show, Matt and South Bend.  Hi, Matt. What's on your mind today?  Morning, Dan. Thanks, Suzanne.  Dan, that's thanks for taking my call.  I have two things for you.  As I've said before, do you have the guy that got you  in the unfortunate, nerding fireball situation?  With the talk last week, it comes in potentially coming back to town.  I wanted to offer first.  See, and I owe you a pie to the face.  If you want to give that to me in person,  I lived here right across the street from nerding,  and I would give you that honor.  Oh, yeah, absolutely. We'll take you up.  We're going to try to go to the USC game.  And the last time we were there, it was a USC game.  We're looking for a beer.  Everybody's tailgating, and my guys go,  well, just be damn Patrick, get us some beers.  So I walk around all of a sudden, I got Matt and his crew,  who say, hey, you want to do a fireball.  And then I said, I'll do one.  And then they, like, 15 cameras came out.  I go, no, no, no, no, no, we're not doing this.  So next time, though, just give me a beer, Matt, not a fireball, okay?  So that was the second part that I wanted to offer you  is being here now 10 years.  I have already arranged it, you guys will want a private tailgate.  Yes.  All the beer will be staged.  The local Miller-Light distributors  already agreed to you on a local grill master.  Okay. That's how you call in and become a friend of the show.  Absolutely. Matt will keep you posted.  But we're going to try to come in for the USC game.  And maybe do the show on campus for a couple of days.  That's my goal.  And for the people in Iowa, I still want to bring the show there.  We just have to find the right time and see if there's anything else going on.  We do want to bring the show to Iowa.  I promise before I call this a career.  We will be an Iowa.  But we're trying to go to South Bend because who knows how many more games  USC in Notre Dame will have.  But Matt, thank you for the invitation.  And we look forward to taking you up on that.  Nathan and San Antonio, hi, Nate.  What's on your mind today?"
"Tue, 14 Oct 2025","Hour 2 – Blake Snell’s Legendary Performance, Topsy-Turvy NFL MVP Odds",10:41,James,Paulie Pabst,Pie,James bets that Paulie will get a pumpkin pie to the face.,James,Paulie Pabst,Paid,2025-12-17,"Good morning.  You're watching on P.Cock.  That's our streaming partner down low the app.  If you haven't done so.  Congrats to the Falcons who looked awesome last night.  And, uh,  Bijon, not Bijon.  It's Bijon.  I think he corrected the media.  It said, you know, actually, my name is Bijon Robinson.  And here is Reheem Morris.  The Falcons head coach on his running back.  I know you have expectations for Bijon, but did you,  you know, how special was this in comparison to his,  what he does every other day?  Yeah, he's the best playing football.  I've said it multiple times.  I can't say it enough.  You know, you can always have your pick.  You can always go up there and figure out what you want to go for.  But like in my opinion, he's the best playing football.  Wow.  Uh, he's certainly playing like the best player in football.  He's off to an incredible start at historical start.  As far as running back and yards from Scrimmage.  Yeah, Paul.  Yeah, this is a big left turn here for Bijon Robinson.  But remember in college he was Bijon, like Dijon mustard.  Yeah.  He actually started a mustard company.  The official Dijon of Bijon.  So how could he change the pronunciation of his name to Bijon?  Because not Dijon mustard.  Well, maybe it's up to Dijon to say,  you have changed the pronunciation of their most.  It's a great deal for him.  I like that.  Oh, look who's here.  James and Virginia.  Hi, James.  Oh, they would take a mackerel.  Brother, happy Tuesday.  D.P.  Dan, that's the root of the command.  His man, big time all the time.  Every time.  I tell you what, D.P.  Man, my wife loves it.  Me, with pies in the face.  Man, she thinks it's a blessing ever.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my, Paulian.  Oh, wait, anything you'd like to say to James in Virginia?  No, I like James too much.  It was a rough knife for him.  You know, just a little slippery, a little slick.  And then your wife's going to hit you with the pie to the face.  Is that right, James?  Yes, and we're looking at pumpkin pies because this is a state pie,  little annoyed, man.  I tell you what, man.  You cannot win football games with penalties and turnovers.  And last night, man, three turnovers, 13 points.  They lose by a point.  It's a big loss for Washington, man.  They followed a three and three.  They had a chance to be first place in the NFC.  Now they fall all the way back to 12.  They're one and three in conference now with the packers,  falcons, and bears all holding tie breakers.  They got a tough road ahead.  B.B. Cowboys, chief sea hawks, lions, or the next four games.  So it's going to be a tough stretch.  I think that's really going to be the heart of the season right there,  or whether they're going to end up that.  But, man, who does to the bears?  They came in with like their 30th rank, Russian friends.  Yeah, I got you, baby.  And, you know, they really played tough.  I mean, Washington got 120, four yards on the ground, but it was tough sledding.  And like I said, they forced the turnovers and won the game, man.  So, probably I'll have that in 40 by Monday, my man.  So you guys have a great day.  Thanks for taking my call on our solicitor commander.  All right.  James down a little bit there.  Yes, Marvin?  It James, if you're still there.  Are you holding your child?  I think he was.  Okay.  Because I got you, baby.  Yeah.  Well, it could be his wife.  That's my hand.  Yes, Paul.  I got to tell you, DP.  Caleb Williams is back.  The under a swim.  He looks swift last night.  He's a swiftest guy at all.  It's the Luther Bears, man.  James and Virginia Laws stay a pie to the face.  Bet.  Josh and North Carolina.  Good morning.  Josh, what's on your mind?  Good morning, Dan Danette.  So, everyone's doing well.  One time first time.  Five, ten.  Father of four, two, thirty, three.  Calling.  I've been listening for the last few weeks.  A couple weeks.  Just roasting, Todd.  About the pastful situation.  And it reminded me when I was learning to drive.  The year was 1999.  I'll take you back.  And my mom was in the passenger seat.  The calmly teaching me how to drive her.  Dodge knee on.  And the best piece of advice you gave.  And Todd, this one's for you.  And I use it in life all the time now.  It's don't let the be behind you drive your car.  So, little defensive Todd.  Living his life, making his choices.  Appreciate you guys.  Love the show.  Thank you, Josh.  Thank you.  There you go, Todd.  I'll take one of those.  Okay.  Overwhelmingly, it gets me so we're, I can grab one where there.  Help in me out of the bed.  I can get some support there.  Yes, you can.  Even state DOTs have like informational videos.  Asking you to not do what Todd and that call are just said.  Specifically asking you, please get out of the lane and move over.  That's the way you're supposed to drive.  You're not supposed to just park in that camp in that left lane.  Please get over.  Even the state is asking, please don't do that.  Yes, Todd.  And you wrote, you alluded to the other day.  I don't, I don't feel like it's camping from going 10 plus miles an hour faster than the speed limit.  And then if I do move over and then the guy that I let go continues to left lane, he's not trying to pass.  But you're not the policeman.  Like, you're not the, this speed police here.  You don't decide.  You can go whatever you want to go.  But if somebody wants to pass you, you can't go.  Well, I'm going 10 miles over.  He should go around me."

The sports broadcasting act of 1961 that protects high school football.  And so they can't do it next year.  Have a Friday night opener.  Is there high school football this Friday night?  I don't.  It's unclear why they can have one this year on Friday night.  Maybe because it's out of the country.  Like an offshore bookie.  Offshore account.  Yeah, it doesn't count if it's outside.  That might be, I'm not even joking.  Maybe it.  But.  Yeah, because I was told, hey, you can't have college games or programs on Friday night because they don't want to take away from high school.  It has to with Labor Day and the start of high school football.  In 2026, Labor Day isn't until September 7th.  That puts the following Thursday, the second week of the month.

What if you had to either dress like Fritzier dress in Syracuse gear for the day or a team you don't like or  Well, how about the team that beats you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's where they're geared.  I would take a lemon meringue pie.  Oh.  In the face when my eyes open.  Okay.  Can I get first team an NCAA tournament history to win 10 consecutive games by at least 13 points?  Happened.  The previous mark by the way, six consecutive games.  Indiana did it back in the early 80s and Lassal did it in the mid 50s.  But the streak of 10 consecutive wins by double digits also an all-time record.  And the previous mark was nine straight.  That was Michigan State back in 2000, 2001.  Stad.  But it did.  Oh.  But.  But.  But.  But.  Here comes that.  What.  Stad.  Stad.  Stad.  Brought to you by.  Panani America the official trading card to this program.  First hour.  Well, I don't know what we solved.  But we spent some time with Bruce Pearl at Auburn and he said no.  He can't root for Alabama might be able to root for the SEC to win the title, but not Alabama.  And we also have a controversy brewing.  Or at least on the back burner, maybe in the oven.  And that is the sandwich the elite eight that we have going on.  And now we have a play in game between a chicken parm and a meatball parm.  Yes.  That's what I'm saying.  That's the plate in game played in game.  Love it.  Love it.  All right.  That's the same thing.  Yeah.  This is exactly what I love.  It's like the most favorite thing.  Yeah.  We've got a plate in game.  Between a meatball parm and a chicken parm.  Okay.  Right now early results 73% with a chicken parm."

Hi, Dave. How are you doing? Great. Jay. Hey, I, I just, real quick, I just want to say it was really cool.  Meet you guys last week in New Orleans. That was pretty awesome. It was like meet Rockstar. So I do appreciate that.  That's the weekend was, Kelmore going to New Orleans, the New Head Coach. It's their second Dallas  Cowboys, Kibi, catch the Cudden New Orleans. So my worst of the weekend was, please,  so I tell Victor, Wendy, Amma to stop shooting a three 10 times a night. I think it blew two games against,  yeah, against two very mediocre teams. All right. Well, I think he's taken about nine a game.  I think they're okay with that. Chuck in Queens. Hi, Chuck. Hey,  Dan, Danette. How are you? Great. Legs mid home safely. Thank you. I have my worst of the weekend.  And then I'll give you my best. The worst of the weekend is Nico Harrison, what a debut by Anthony Davis.  And then he goes down for a month with an injury in the first game at his new team. I think that was  literally a trochist, especially on the heels of tonight. Being Lucas, Dave, you with the Lakers.  And it's being shown everywhere on every single network that ASP and an ABC on their showing  that. So Nico Harrison had the worst weekend in my opinion. And the best weekend was my same  chance and my pie winning bet. Whoa, Marvin. That's right. Marvin. We won one next  sell center. We are now the favorites to win the big East and the big East Postseason tournament.  And we are in the top 10 for the first time in 30 plus years. Yeah, I covered that St. John's team when  they were in the top 10 last time. Rick Patino, Marvin. You lost a pie bet. I did. That was a great performance.  I didn't realize they were that good. And they've only lost once in conference play. Yeah. And he's  they asked them, what do you feel about that loss? He's like, I'm shocked that we lost that one.  Yeah, they are good. He had some colorful language, but you know what, he's an incredible coach.  Unbelievable. Yes, he is. There's a lot of things that you might say about Rick Patino. But the one thing  you must say is he's one of the greatest coaches basketball coaches of all time. He is. He'll eventually  get a team together and he'll win. And that's what he did at St. John's. He's done that every place he's gone.  But you know, you get chances. I mean, I don't know. I don't know. And you'll get to them to the tournament.  You're like, it doesn't matter. He will out coach you at some point. And whatever I hear Iona,  it always reminds me of the joke that Jim Dalbano used to say because Coach Valvano was at Iona.  And he said that he would recruit and then you know, kid would say, or family would say, well,  yeah, who are you where he goes, yeah, Coach, Coach Valvano, Iona College. And they're like,  well, what college? He goes, Iona. And they go, no, what, wait, what college do you want? He goes,  I, no, it's Iona. So they kept hearing him say, Iona College. Well, good. Good for you. You must be really rich.  No, I coach at Iona College. All right. We'll take a break. Our best in worst of the weekend,  more of your phone calls as well after this.

You know, and Pickins is going to go, how can I get this next contract?  I don't know.  It's just that that's a Molotov cocktail.  Where you just go, hey, come on in.  Yes, he feels like in that position though, you need two guys to have one guy.  You need, you need somebody to help CD Lamb get open.  Yeah, he, so now you got, now you got two.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  CD better get his touches though, that's all.  Yeah, he will.  That's the guy right there, man.  If he doesn't, his mom's going to get mad at Dac Presca.  First thing we got to do is get him off the Cowboys and then his careers.  Send him to the commanders.  And then we're gonna come in.  Yes, now what?  Oh, yes.  Josh and Pennsylvania.  Hi, Josh.  What's on your mind today?  Oh, guys, one third to questions.  And like CD Lamb is your guy.  Ferguson's a good to know.  Josh.  Hi.  This is John from Las Vegas.  Oh, oh, so wait, my God, don, well, okay.  Where's Josh?  I'm here.  Okay, D.B.  I said one third to be good.  I'm just saying I put money on the giants making the playoffs over the Cowboys.  Oh, okay.  God, would there D said and I thought more wide receiver and about your quarterback?  All right.  Does anybody want to piece of Josh that the giants will make the playoffs?  Paul?  Make the playoffs.  Make the playoffs.  Yeah, I'll take that.  Just send it with the money now.  All right.  How about a pie to the face, Josh?  All right, fair enough.  All right.  Is that the New York giants?  Just double checking.  Rick and I will wait.  Wait, I have to just quickly.  So that bet was that the giants will make the playoffs.  He says they will.  The bet that I had with Paul and Jay earlier was that the Cowboys won't make the playoffs.  You guys are taking the Cowboys won't make the playoffs.  So Paul, you're taking that the giants are in the playoffs and the Cowboys are out of the playoffs.  I don't know.  He's got the giants not in the playoffs.  Okay.  And then the Cowboys aren't going to be in the playoffs.  But Jay didn't take that bad.  Okay.  Got it.  I'm just trying to keep the bet straight.  Yeah, Rick and Ohio.  Hi, Rick.  What's on your mind?  Hey, Dan.  Thanks for taking the call.  Taking a look at the Pittsburgh receivers.  What do you think about a Murray Cooper that three pretty good years in Cleveland without a quarterback?  Last year, not a real good performer with Buffalo.  But none of the receivers really stood out.  He'd be a great possessive receiver, I think, for the larger receivers.  Yeah, I don't.  Is he available?  I don't know what he's going to call us.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I haven't studied the depth chart here with some of these receivers who are going to be available.  I like a Murray Cooper.  But, you know, didn't seem to do much in Buffalo.  Now is 14.  So, you know, there's an expiration date for all of these guys depending on what position you play.  You got about five to seven years and that's about it.  If you're running back or wide receiver, you know, less than that may be for running back.  Yeah, Martin.  I'm our Cooper Hall of very good.  Nice.  Good.  All a good.  Yeah, all a good.  Pretty good.  He got paid pretty good.  Oh, all the fame.  Yeah.  I'm sure I won't get it.  One of the great shooters of all time.

By the way,  Travis Kelsey talked about how old he is and how long he wants to play with the chiefs.  I just love coming in here man. It's kind of I mentioned St. Joe was my sanctuary. I just love football  and how it it takes me away from life and it gives me something I can feel genuinely happy about.  I enjoy coming in the building, working on my craft, getting to understand a new game plan and  perfecting that for the people around me. It gives me a purpose to kind of go about my day and  and to live my life and I just I have so much excitement doing it. It's going to be hard trying to figure  out when to call the quits and I. Yeah, I think he's also talked about he didn't if he has a limited role  then he's not going to play that he wants to play and wants to be out there as much as possible.  But at age 35 he's got his whole fame career. He and his brother just signed a $100 million  pod council deal and you happen to be dating maybe the most famous person on the planet right now in  Taylor Swift. I don't know about this arrangement. I mean that would be weird that you're flying around  your on stage with her you went out of your way to try to get her attention. It's kind of weird like  the weirdest part is believing that's real. I mean did Travis Kelsey need to do this? Did Taylor Swift  need to do this? I got it Kelsey became really really famous and probably a large reason why you got  a $100 million pod council is your Taylor Swift's boyfriend and you and your brother have an entertaining  pod council but it went to a whole another level here but did Travis Kelsey need to do this?  Did she need to do this? I still think they get engaged. I think Fritzian I have a a wedding cake  that not pie to the face wedding cake to the face if they don't get engaged.

Oh, they're back right  controlling their own destiny again with the two quality losses. Great to talk to you. Thanks for joining  us have a great week. Always a pleasure, my friend Rick new Heisel former college coach known  analyst for CBS sports James in Virginia. Hi James. What's on your mind?  I'm just one of the great weekend football man. I was telling Simon that the SEC is just  hot full of teams. Weekend and week out. You just got sugar knocked Matt. I still really like LSU. But  then my Ole Miss Texas and even Georgia they all got chances in that league. I tell you what man,  you look at Ole you scheduled the rest of the way. They're just in the outlet. Ole Miss and get  for the next two weeks. They could go on the speed. I can't wait to see what happens.  Brookley with the NFL Washington man. This is a huge game for Washington and America is about to meet the  commanders and they've been Daniel. The next seven weeks tonight, we're the next seven weeks there. Five  times in two games of the week. It's going to be crazy. But the energy is so big. There'll be  six teams that are four and two and like two five and one green base three one and one. So they  got to keep pace. They got to win tonight. If you're up for a police, I'll do it five in the face. But it's  got to be straight up. No points man. As you would take them on the gentleman's a little bit of a man. There's  not a great day. All right. The bears are getting five and a half at the commanders. How confident do you  feel about your bears? Paul. lightly lightly confident. To be honest, I don't feel great about it.  They can't stop the run and Washington can run. That's a bad mix. Okay. I would like to do a  bet be side's pie to the face, something I saw see with James. Like I don't know. You guys fill in the  parameters. I'll do the bat. Get a tent too. Hmm. Every time we would do wheel punishment. I mean, like  get a tent too. Shame your head. Yeah. Tell your face. How about Paul has to do an entire show  as an impression of James of Virginia? I don't know how to do that. Yes, you do.  Lot of a high energy and one breath. Love the hair, Dan. It's looking good. The  can't believe you want to Maine means the best. They don't have good football. Um, it's tired already.  Completely wiped out. And then James has to do a pie to the face. Sure. I think that's good.  Yeah. All right. James, Paul, you'll take you up on it. Oh, man. Thank you, Dan.  Why? It's so wild. Nick and LA. Hi, Nick. What's on your mind today?  Hey, Dan, how the toilet? Uh, just a fact. And each day with enthusiasm, unknown to mankind.  Getting ready for those testing underdog divers today. I got I got two best of the weekend. The chargers  with their fifth and sixth string offensive tackles and Justin Herbert looking like hurt you,  Lee's back there with the game winning drive. Justin Herbert had 18 game winning drives since 2020,  only behind Patrick McCombs. Number two, CP zone Jerry new highs will throw it up 38 points yet again.  One has gotten into Westwood. Have a great week, boys. Thank you, Nick. Yeah, they roughed up  Michigan State. I was impressive. And I think this is the last year of his contract as the offensive  coordinator at UCLA. I'm guessing Rick's son is probably going to have an opportunity to maybe be a head coach after this season.  Aaron in Virginia, higher in what's on your mind today. Hey, happy Monday, B. P.  Dan, it's a fantastic man. I just want to shout out Virginia. I feel like we've had a lot of colors from Virginia here recently.  The only thing that I wanted to comment on today is to God about two months ago who was  keeping tabs of all the heights and weights coming in. I feel like we need to tell the second and third time  colors to not say they're height and weight. That's going to skew his results. Oh, yeah, we had the person who gave us the  average height and weight of my listeners. Thank you, Aaron. We'll get some of our best people on it."

So I've had a lot of it's history.  F1's always race in the rain.  So they've always had tires developed for the rain.  And if it's especially last 20 years have tracks developed with runoff for safety.  Or as NASCAR is never race in the rain.  And you're usually on an oval and you've got no runoff.  You've also got tired development that plays a huge role.  They're very, very different tires.  You're not just slicks with grooves, cut in them.  So you've got manufacturers that would have to develop tires for NASCAR that would make them work correctly.  And then kind of like the NFL.  But people who run it always want to talk about safety safety safety.  It's not really part of it.  I mean, it is.  But that's that's some of it that goes into it.  And then T.D. slots.  F1 runs globally.  So you've got to keep that time slot for all the people broadcasting around the world.  Here in the US when NASCAR gets bumped in our.  It affects things, but not nearly to the level.  So that's that's another big reason why they have to keep that time slot.  They have to make the cars go out so that everybody can be happy globally.  Thank you, Jake.  Yes, Paul.  Yeah, NASCAR the long straightaway type courses they don't run in the rain.  Like a walk in Glenn or a Sonoma in California.  Those road courses they will do it if it's drizzling or rainy.  Shuffles in Arizona, high shuffles.  There's a.  There's a.  There down.  We're down.  We're down.  I'm just calling in to remind Martin that we had a pile of the face that.  Oh, let's write Arizona, Connecticut.  Yeah, Arizona, Connecticut.  Last.  I'm not going to get ahead of myself because.  It is on on occasion in the in the turn.  I might struggle.  But at least for today.  I'm reveling in this as I think of the entire world.  That nation is, but it's one of the colon and remind Martin and was that I just want to say one thing which is.  Thanks.  Arizona, beat Connecticut.  7167 and Arizona out rebound of the Husky's 4323.  So you have a pie to the face coming.  You and Shuffles had that bet that Arizona was playing.  I had to get that Connecticut.  Yes, but per usual Arizona's going to celebrate in November.  You're not going to celebrate in the March and April.  Wow, that's smack talk there.  That all Arizona won.  Yeah.  In November.  Yeah.  But you know, they're going to be on my bracket.  I'm going to look at Arizona.  I know.  When they're two seedlings.  Oh, yeah.  Jackson State.  Not again.  A million.  I will not make that mistake with the charges or Arizona basketball.  I won't.  Every single year.  I will not do.  It's always a lottery pick and it's like, man, he went to Arizona.  Yeah.  Oh, they lost in the first round.  Yes.  Of course.  Pretty usual.  It's like North Carolina football where you go.  Yeah.  They had a couple of first round picks on that roster.  And they ended up going, you know, six and six.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How do you have peppers and Albert Haynes worth and not make them, you know, they were fantastic.  Yes, Todd.  We look forward to the making the round of 32 and then we could all but red X's all.

I'm going to take a break.  Yeah.  Confirmed.  I know.  What's the poll question for our two?  Do we have?  Well, yeah.  We're throwing up literally.  We're putting up there at F1 Rugby cricket.

We got a couple of them up there right now.  Who would you rather have?  Anthony Davis and Cooper Flag or Luke Adonches?  I think that people are getting this wrong.  I think I would still rather have Luke up than both of those dudes.  That's just me though.  We also put up there.  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  So if I said to Dallas,  we're going to send Luke back and but Cooper Flag and Adir going to the Lakers.  So you're saying if you're Dallas you would still want Luke up.  I would. What would the Lakers want?  I think you should want Luke at too.  If you put it another way that's that's extremely disrespectful,  but okay, I'll throw it out there.  Would you rather have street clothes and a high school kid or?  Or a grown man in street clothes?  Yeah, I know that Luke has proven his greatness and Cooper Flag is projected to be great.  AD certainly helps that void in the middle that Minnesota took advantage of.  Everybody took advantage of it seemed like.  Yeah, that's interesting.

Where do you want the pie is such a funny way to take a quick what I want the pie?  He said yes.  And why won't the pie in the face?  I mean, no, but you said yesterday that you would take a pie to the groin.  I did not.  But for a content sake, I will take a pie.  I heard.  I don't know because we talked about, you know, who wins if they're giving you a pie to the groin?  Yeah, and I listen back and I, it's fathically said no.  I don't know.  Pants.  It's like absolutely.  You know that.  Okay.  In my head, there was a curse word, but you know what?  It's probably easier cleanup.  So I'm going to take a pie to the plums.  Okay.  All right.

They sell per claim, fastest guy in the building.  Everybody wants to.  I, there was a big argument the other day about who's the fastest guy in the building?  All the backroom guys and and all of a sudden they say, all right, I'll put up $500.  You guys have a race, winner take all.  And one of the people we thought would be involved in be one of the favorites who did come out and  say that he could beat Zion Williamson in a race, Rob, the resident Nick's fan, he says that  he's not racing.  And I went, okay.  I don't know why, but he did say he would beat Zion in a race.  Like, so random.  You know, you know, fast I am, I could beat Zion.  What?  So I put my yearly salary.  Yeah, I'm taking Zion.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm taking Zion.  But now he might be able to beat Luca, but I don't think he's going to be.  No, it's still not.  Yeah.  Yeah. So we're going to have that for you.  Be who was the fastest man in the building?  Yeah, have that for you coming up.  That's a major accomplishment.

You know, the Alabama placing is a little questionable prior to the college football  play of committee reveal. Miami put him in front of Notre Dame. Nobody want to have a problem with that.  I wouldn't. But when you let them jump, Alabama is non-competitive in the SEC title again. Yes,  they got there, but they were not competitive at all. And then you're not dropping. I don't know. It just  felt a little nefarious there. Todd, best in worst of the weekend. My best of the weekend. They lost their  football coach. But I was state basketball sadly dominated number one, Purdue, 81, 58 with the help of 113  Boyle and makers 23 point lost largest non-conference home loss by a number one team in a  people history tied for the largest homeless ever by a number one team. Wow. Worst, Alabama getting  shut up for the first three quarters against Georgia. They lose the game by three types of 287. The  dogs had 141 total resting yards crimson tied negative three. Seaton, best in worst. My best of the  weekend is Mike Tomlin getting a huge dove against the Ravens. I guess I'm not any good at coaching.  Why don't I just beat the Ravens then? My worst of the weekend Tampa Bay losing. That was an  absolute must win. They've lost. I think five of the last seven or something like that. If there was an  NFL playoff selection committee, they would be on the outside looking in. Marvin Bestard worst. Best of  the weekend. Titans run back Tony Pollard. 25 carries 261 yards to touchdowns. Worst of the weekend.  The commanders. What happened this season after making the NFC championship game last year? They're now  three and ten and they got shut out. No harder this for NFL 2 to get shut out. I'm watching the Broncos  and the Raiders. I have this bet with Todd. I had the Raiders with a better record than the Broncos.  So I got to get a pie to the face. I think they're 11 and two and two and 11 right now. Like,  standing there. So can we call now we can settle the bet now? Probably. I can see the Raiders catching up  with four games. All right. Maybe double and nothing. I got to make it like a 30 games schedule or something.  So you're down by 10. The line is seven and a half and the end of the game you kick a field goal  and then all of a sudden you lose by seven when the line is seven and a half. What team goes for a field goal  at the end of the game when you know that you need 10 points. So you're going to get you're not even going  for a touchdown. Oh. Yes, Todd. The only thing I thought I was there were hoping the kick would take  less than five seconds and then they cut it to seven and onside kick with one second left that somehow  they pick up and run in for a touchdown. Something crazier things have happened. I guess technically  but you can't advance on on side. Oh, yeah. So I don't even know. So there be time for one play. If they  got to probably not I don't think so but once again. I do watch the lines as a former gambler and  I'm always curious. Like whenever there's a last second you know play one way or another I go how did that  affect the spread and most times it does. Pauli best in Worcester the weekend. I got two best as obvious  that it is. The Indiana Hoosiers beating Ohio State and doing with defense they held him the 58 yards rushing  2.2 a carry if you're from earth Indiana being the number one football team in the country is one of  the wildest stories of my lifetime unbelievable and then one that went under the radar a little bit this weekend.

Yeah.  I'm a parent, but like I think Charles Barclays underrated because he's such a character  and a personality and his career doesn't get the do and Ricky Henderson's first from 20 to  33 he was lights out.  Yeah, great player.  You, you, whenever he got up or got on, then he made it interesting.  But that's when the stolen base meant something.  You know, that team's really cared about it.  Now it's coming back a little bit, but there's nobody that you go all the way he's on.  Because Ricky with he was on first, he was going to end up on third.  You could have a sack fly and he's going to score.  Yes, more.  And it's crazy because guess who's next?  Maguire and Conceaco.  I bet line of beers.  Is that line of underrated?  That was a great line of great, great line of.  But you know, that's part of the problem of being artificially inflated where you might not  give them credit, but then do they deserve credit?  No, I saw a picture of Maguire when he was he had to be a rookie and he was so lean.  But he did hit like 49 home runs back then when he looked like that.  Chris and Syracuse, I Chris, what's on your mind today?  Hey, Danny, I got a couple of things for you.  I guess we're talking Chris Carter that bikes got him for 100 bucks off waivers from the Eagles.  I think another reason the Reds in the World Series every year, they had a win the division  to get in and the Dodgers were so good.  The Reds were win close to 100 games and they wouldn't make it.  And off of Fritz he'd be an off for the Jewish holiday.  It got me thinking about Sandy Cofax, who risks a World Series start.  I think because of the same holiday and I think it was Don Drysdale was a rookie and he got  the start for that game and he was interviewed and he said he went like 2 and a third and  he got shelved and it's the manager took the ball from him as he was walking back to the  dugout he turned and said he skipped.  I bet you wish I were Jewish.  Thank you Chris.  So Fritz he is Sandy Cofax and Dylan is Don Drysdale.  I'm fine with being Drysdale.  Hall of Famer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm not fine with Fritz he being Sandy Cofax though.  That seems extreme but they are left handed in Jewish and that's where the similarities  end.  Sam and St. Louis.  Hi Sam what's on your mind.  Yeah.  Dan I was calling about a line up from three years ago that potentially has four Hall of Famers  on it.  Between them they have 36 all star appearances, 25 gold gloves and four MVP awards and that line  up would be the St. Louis Cardinals with Malina Pouholes or Narado and Goldschmint.  Yeah.  That's a really good line up.  Looks like Pouholes is going to get the Angel's managerial job.  How about that?  He's done some managing.  I think I don't know if he's done it in Winterball but he's done some managing and looks  like already Marino is going to bring him in.  Yeah.  Paul.  Pouholes is still going to get paid by the Angel's.  Yeah.  You can pay it by him for a long time now.  Let's keep it going.  Jesus.  I don't know if he's he's been getting paid by him.  But yeah.  He's going to make more money.  Let's see.  Antoine and Fort Latterdale.  Antoine, what's on your mind?  Hey, what's up, VP?  5, 6, 180.  First time long time.  Just a quick clarification being a bit hurricane saying, can't work actually holds the record for  the most touch thousand college football.  What's 58?  And how you got it?  What's the three-burns your boys?  He was also in the 84 supplemental draft.  All right.  Well, thank you.  Yeah, but he went to the USFL and then he was in the supplemental draft."

We'd have to fight a box of his wig, but the way the demos playing way they don't wake up to the fourth quarter.  I don't know what to expect from them.  Okay.  Can you go on Amazon and specifically ask for a Mark Davis hairpiece?  I'll do a search and see what that comes up.  I'll get the big German to go on Amazon and help us find something that looks like a Mark Davis hairpiece there.  I like that.  Content time.  Talk on all about content.  Thank you, David.

I don't, out here in West Texas.  I don't keep up with baseball.  I'll watch the fall classic of man Friday and Saturday.  And even the full series has been so entertaining.  I mean, even a non baseball fan can appreciate.  You know, everything the daughters are doing.  Another best of the weekend and Cam little kicker for the Jaguar.  These things are getting ridiculous, man.  I mean, that is just going to be kicking from midfield at this point.  And go cowboys tonight.  All right.  Thank you, Cody.  Yeah, I said at the beginning of the year that we would have a new NFL record because these kickers are so good.  I still think we're going to have a 70 yard field goal this year, because using it that closing out a game or closing out a half.  But now 68 it's 68 and room despair.

Well, why don't you go get that?  And if you can't find the suggestion box.  I'm going to go hit you with a pie.  I got I pulled it out of the suggestion box during the commercial.  That's how to write it.  God knows. Hey.  5 minute poll question from the suggestion box.  Fritchie dot dot dot.  Sucks the air out of the room.  Just sucks.  Just plain sucks.  Is bullied too much.

Just seeing that all of the above would be apt.  Okay. Marvin.  How would you vote on this?  The all of the above.  Oh, okay.  See.  Oh, man.  It is all of the above.  But the percentages are heavily weighed in some direction.  I would say.  We've fully taught way too much.  I personally, I think we've been way too much.  Time talking about touch.  We break down every possible angle of his personality.  His toes to his toes.  His toes to his hairless legs to his soft hands to did he say that's word right  to out any brief to be wholly crap.  Well, that's going to be a heavy part of that.  But yes, all of the other things are definitely part of the equation.  Paul has an obsession with Fritchie's appearance.  I don't do it on air very much.  Sometimes I'll do it more sitting around more so.  Yeah.  But you do have an obsession.  Even when he's getting a pie to the face, you go,  he had a shoes off.  You go, Todd, you have nice toes.  And then I'm like, really?  Todd, you have no hair on your legs.  Okay.  We analyze Todd's body.  Little too much.  I do go for a pedicure.  Like, I went some of these days.  Well, I don't know that.  I did not know.  Nobody had a gelker.  I've noticed.  Yeah.  You got a nice little massage and everything.  I think it might nails painted, but I got a...  Got it done.  I don't think you've sucked the air out of the room.  I hope I don't just suck.  But the worst choice of all of them.  I'd rather suck the air out of the room.  You just sucked in general?  I think you're good.  You're good in bad content.  I could live with that.  That's what you are.  There's nobody like you.  In our business,  every one of these shows is trying to find a Todd Fritz.  Every single one of them.  And they can't.  How about that?  That's a lovely compliment.  Thank you.

T-shirt.  But some of those T-shirt ideas better as bumper stickers.  So that when people are coming up behind that left lane camp,  they can read the Todd Fritz bumper sticker.  I think Todd just takes his need to lead and to be in charge out when he's in the car.  He's not in charge at home.  He definitely isn't in charge at the at the show.  He has OPP to deal with, like we just talked about, overbearing Paul.  And so he takes it out when he's in that left lane.  And he camps.  He tells everybody behind him.  You're not going as fast as you want.  Unless I let you.  So he just takes it out there.  I'm not a left lane camp.  Don't agree with him.  But I do think he is content.  Good and bad.

So going even 15 miles an hour faster.  Think about.  People who like cattle, they just kind of follow along.  And one person does the next.

Eight pounds, three ounces, twenty and a half inches.  Yeah.  Yeah, a little Mac, a little Mac, a little Mac a run.  So I mean, I think we're actually crushing it with the baby stuff.  Well, let our pediatrician decide that.  But we got a big problem.  He's born Sunday.  Pacters lost.  And we're on a three-game losing strength for the brewers.  I just need some assurance is that this baby coming in the world didn't wreck our tanks and  October here.  I need some tangible.  I need some tangible assurance.  I don't know if I'd bring that up to your wife.  You know, after a C section, just say I don't know.  I think Max Abad.  You know, bad luck.  You got to burn some sage around this kid or something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think you're going to be okay with the packers.  The brewers, it was a wonderful regular season.  I just don't know if they're built for the postseason.  Hey, you can always fall back on the Wisconsin badge.  Excellent.  Excellent.  That's a good thing.  It's coming down.  Congratulations on the baby there, Dan.  And don't give percentile.  Okay.  Just a heads up.  You know, you don't have to give the percentile of my child is in the 98th percentile,  or you don't have to do that.  Because it doesn't mean anything.

Thank you.  Thank you, David.  Pat and Virginia.  Hi, Pat.  What's on your mind?  Come on, Dan.  I had a question for your journalism.  I think that is that with the merger of the NFL and ESPN, I was told that the equity  part goes divided by the owners.  How did they monetize that to put that into the salary cap?  They don't put it in the salary cap.  I don't think the players get that equity with ESPN and NFL network or NFL.  Now, I'm guessing the CBA, collective bargaining agreement.  We'll have something to say about that.  But Mike Florio brought that up yesterday.  They're getting 10% of ESPN.  I think the owners are getting 10% of ESPN.  Shuffles in Phoenix.  High shuffles.  Good morning, Dan.  I'm calling in.  I'm doing my own journal list at an ass work here.  And also, I'm calling contracts because back to Ken, I think May.  You had to add them silver on.  Do you remember that conversation with Adam?  Specifically what part of the conversation?  The part where you told Adam that you have three years to go, which means you're going to be  gone to roughly May of 2028.  And you said it on the air, which I think is a binding content.  You have to do it.  I think and bring it aside.  Because you told Adam, not once, not twice.  But twice at that time, I had three years left.  I was rejoicing because I figured, you are going to stick around longer than we anticipate.  And that's actually evidence of it.  Another thing I wanted to bring up is you and modernism always disparage theirs on a wild  catch.  I wanted to see if you guys would be willing to do a pie to the face coming up because Connecticut  and Arizona are going to be playing for the next two years during the regular season.  So I wanted to throw down a got-with on Connecticut.  Arizona, I think Arizona, you guys can take Connecticut.  I'm not backing Connecticut.  I didn't go there and that's Marvin's alma mater.  And shuffles, I think you have to admit, Arizona kind of finds the banana peel and basketball.  I disagree.  We should have three national championships.  I was there when you won your national championship.  I mean, I should have six Emmys, but I don't have any.  Not with the show.  It was good friends with Lood Olsen and his wife.  I was there.  Yes, Marvin.  I will take that.  Okay, you got it, Shuffles.  Marvin will take the bet each of the next two years.  Yep.  We guys don't go to the final four, don't make any more excuses.  Wow.

Hey, Dan, I'm flying up to you, South for College in a few weeks with my dad, who thinks Bill,  and I've been listening to your show for as long as I can remember with my dad.  We're going to drive out there and call you during your drive.  We decided to fly last minute, so I decided to call in and surprise my dad.

"Thu, 06 Mar 2025","Hour 2 – Sports Mysteries, Mike Florio",29:57,Dan Patrick,Paulie Pabst,Pie,Paul bets that Shidorah Sanders will be drafted in the first five and a half picks.,Dan Patrick,Paulie Pabst,Paid,2025-06-26,"What was your takeaway after the conversation?  Great personality, magnetic.  You can see that his dad is D on Sanders very worldly.  Kind of mature beyond his years.  Know how to deal with people very well.  A lot of emotional intelligence.  I was impressed with him.  But, but I know what's going to happen.  The chatter's already begun.  And I think the chatter stems from one very simple fact when we had D on Sanders at the Super Bowl.  I pressed him on this question of, are you ever interested in coaching in the NFL?  Because he's given different answers over the past couple of years about that.  And he told us the only way he would ever coach in the NFL is if he was coaching his son.  That creates for some coaches.  I think a hesitation to ever sign off on your team drafting Shidorah Sanders because you might be signing your own pink slip.  Because D on ends up being the coach of the team that Shidorah Sanders goes to.  At least that's one of the concerns that one of these coaches would have.  So I think that's where some of these noise is coming from.  You've got coaches who are thinking, wait a minute.  I don't want to have D on Sanders hovering over me.  If we have his son as our quarterback and I think the four D chess that D on might be playing here by saying what he said,  you scare away the coaches of the dysfunctional teams.  The coaches who would be worried about outside noise from D on and maybe you engineer a little slide down to a team where it is stable.  It isn't dysfunctional and the coaches sufficiently secure and confident that he's not worried about the possibility that D on Sanders would want to become the coach of the team that is son's playing for.  So it could work out well for Shidorah.  The noise that's going to start and it's already started, it could cause him to drop.  But he could drop into a good spot, not a team with a history of derailing the careers of young quarterbacks.  Paul and I have a pie to the face bet.  Shidorah Sanders over under first five and a half picks.  Wow.  I would say at this point he will and I don't know what over under is I guess it's over.  I think that his window opens with the Raiders at six.  Okay.  Don't you always supply to the face, Mike?  I think I'll go get a couple.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know you don't want to hurt the hair, but I mean, it's some point.  I don't want to knock off the two pack.  You're hair looks great.  Thank you.  Just like Tom Brady's.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Mine's real.  I don't know about his.  Mine's real.  My wife says from Tom the Tom, you should just shave your head so everyone can see it's not a two pay.  I am afraid of two things.  Number one, it might not grow back.  And number two, Dan, I am afraid that my head is misshapen and I don't want to find out along with the rest of the world that it is.  Not everybody looks like Michael Jordan with their head shaved.  That's true.  That's true.  That's true.  Scottie Pippen, I think, had his head shaved one time and I was like, no, no.  No.  No.  Are you going to be at the draft in Green Bay?  Yeah.  I've been to the draft since the last time I was in New York.  It's so much easier to work it from home because the only people at the draft for the people who run the cards to the  podium.  Not now the players are there, but it had gotten harder and harder to get good access to them for interviews and stuff.  I had a time which is to zoom interviews with them and I do it all from here.  I go down to the barn and we do videos after every pick and it's much more effective here.  Great to talk to you.

Marvin.  You've been piling on the Jacksonville Jaguar?  Not on purpose, but I don't feel bad about it.  Okay.  So what's the bet, Dylan?  The bet is whoever's closer to their over under right now.  I understand that the 49ers I think are a 10.  The 49ers I think are a 10.  The half wins.  I think the Jaguar is seven.  The half.  So whoever's closer to that over under win, the other person has to do a pile of face.  Marvin?  How about I take the under and you take the over on your Jaguar.  We'll just keep it simple.  What?  I'm under for the 49ers.  Okay.  No, no, no, no.  He's going to take seven wins or less for the Jags where you have to take eight.  You have to take eight wins or more for the Jags.  Perfect.  Men, I'm all about it.  All right.  Pieder the face.  Is somebody keeping track of all these pines through the face?

That last caller said he's a fan of the Jacksonville football team, but he called it the Jaguiers.  I still hear Jaguyer.  Is that correct or is it Jaguars?  Well, there's a car and then there's the animal.  Is there like a British pronunciation?  I think there's Jaguars.  Jaguars.  But I just, in fact, when I was doing sports center, we would make fun of it.  We just call it Jaguars just because it, you know, people say, I don't know.  It's Jaguars.

We'll come up with a new one.  We'll talk about the NFL's new first down measuring system from last night.  And I'm going to bring back what I talked about of the AFC West with the coaches.

He said that Notre Dame is going undefeated and winning the national championship.  Well, all four dannets held up their hand.  They're going to go against that bet.  Notre Dame will not go undefeated and win the national championship.  We start there with Andy Staples, one of the great college football reporters in America.  He works for on three sports.  Let's look at Notre Dame's schedule.  Paulie, give me the schedule here with Notre Dame.  It's a saucy Miami.  They are at for Notre Dame.  They're at Miami.  Host text A&M.  Host Purdue.  At Arkansas to start.  OK.  You think Notre Dame can go undefeated.  Andy.  Paulie strikes me as a as a blueberry guy.  Maybe one of those lattice work apple pie guys.  I mean, I really you guys do need to start thinking about the pie that you would like to get  in the face.  Wow.  I think yeah.  OK.  It's possible.  It is possible they can go 12 and 0 winning the national titles a bit harder because you've  got to get through that entire tournament.  But hell, they got to the national title game last year.  Andy, are you willing to take a pie to the face if Notre Dame doesn't go undefeated?  Yeah, take a pie of the faces.  I can't do it.  Where are we going?  I love you.  I love you.  I know what I need to do it.  I'll just look.  A Northern Illinois game can happen to you.  And they could go to Miami in a lose week one.  But this is one of those seasons.  It just feels like we don't know anything.  But Notre Dame feels like one of the sure things which is interesting because they are  breaking in a new starting quarterback and we don't really know how that's going to look.  But we do know they're going to have one of the best offensive lines in college football.  Jeremiah Love is probably the best back in college football.  And I think the receivers, you're going to see them.  And Jane, great house, you saw toward the end of the playoff, like really step up.  So I do think you're going to see a more dynamic version of the name offense even though  you got to do quarterback probably CJ Carr.  You point out that six of the eight betting favorites to win the national championship are  going to break in new starting quarterbacks.  Texas is technically breaking in a new quarterback, but it's a well-known quarterback.  Handicap, you know, these teams who are, you know, and the new quarterbacks we should be aware of.  So the new of the new guys, Archmany is the one probably who has the most experience.  So of those six teams, that's Texas Ohio State, Georgia, Notre Dame, Oregon, Alabama.  Arch has quite a bit of experience.  Oregon's starting quarterback Dante Moore had some experiences UCLA started a couple years ago.  But Arch probably has been the most ready for this.  And it's interesting because if Arch comes in and they're significantly more dynamic offensively than  then we're last year, you're going to get those retroactive questions of C.  Star Keasian, why didn't you start Arch over Quinn you were earlier?  But I'm fascinated to see what he looks like because I think people who just see the last  name, they're thinking, oh, this guy is going to look like Peyton or Eli.  He is not.  Arch is a dual threat quarterback.  His dad Cooper was a wide receiver who would have been a good wide receiver to Ole Miss,"

I think if you ask USC fans when Lincoln Riley got hired, if in year four, they'd be pointing  toward the following year.  It's not what they wanted.  They don't seem particularly excited about their chances in the big 10 this year.  I do think they're very excited about who's on long street, their freshman quarterback, but I  don't know that Lincoln Riley's ready to throw him into the fire yet.  It sounds like they're going to still go with Jade Mayava.  This is a team that it's not been built up in the trenches.  The way it should have been since Lincoln Riley got there.  It seems like in recruiting they are trying to do that now.  I just don't know that that's it's not ready for this season yet.  I think they're probably looking at an average job of average season in the big 10, which  is not what you're paying 10 million bucks a year for.  They're patient.  Far more patient, but it's because of that contract I'm guessing.  That's a big reason.  There's a lot of two expensive to fire coaches right now.  That under pressure list could have been a lot longer, but Luke Vickalut was constant,  Mark Stoops at Kentucky Lincoln Riley at USC.  You're not firing them.  You are not raising that much money and firing them.  It's just not worth it.  Great to talk to you, Salways Andy.  Thank you for joining us.  Thank you, Dan.  Appreciate it.  Andy Staples covers college football for on three sports.  You have the USC situation.  USC doesn't come up in conversation.  Even Alabama ranked eighth.  It just feels weird.  Been a while since we've gone only on by the way, Alabama.  But you got I got the odds to win the national title for Notre Dame plus 1200.  The odds to go undefeated regular season plus 400.  All right.  So Andy Staples willing to take a pie to the face, it sounded like he was agreeing with  our caller.  Working with him, they could go undefeated there.  We'll be there for the USC Notre Dame game.  South Bend.  Yes, Paul.  Tuskegeele for USC right out of the box.  They host Missouri State.  Host Georgia Southern.  Pause there.  They host their at Purdue at Michigan State.  Still weird.  At Illinois.  Okay.  It's a little tougher.  Then Michigan.  Ron and Texas, I John, what's on your mind today?  Morning, Dan.  Morning, John.  First time, long time.  Five, seven, or recently retired, but 50.  Thank you for that.  A couple of comments, Dan first.  You're the greatest.  You interviewed better than anybody.  And this Jerry Jones, saying, let's get real.  That eight million has cost you change.  You're even recorded this last week.  But John, it's about the salary cap.  We know he's a billionaire, but it's about the salary.  You got to play by the same rules as everybody else.  That's why I bring up the $8 million dollars that you're going to pay extra.  And then that cost you.  Keep in mind, this is a team that decided not to bring in derauch Henry.  If you have extra money, do you think derauch Henry could have helped you?  Last year.  Or this year.  Those are the things that sometimes the little things that you can't keep somebody.  They got DAC, they got CD, they'll have micoparsons.  Boy, that's a three-headed monster, but it feels really top-heavy.  You got to have a look at the chiefs in the number of players who've contributed to their success.

I'm thinking that maybe we send Luis so home to the red socks from David Ortiz.  Oh, hang up and listen. Then you go, what do we send them? Benny Egg by Onny and two picks for Roger Clemens.

Andy Reed is a hall of favor. It helps if you have the guy. I can have the best game plan ever.  If you don't go out and execute, it doesn't matter how good my game plan is.  And I think that's the window. Can Brock pretty go out and execute the way Patrick Mahomes does.  As you move forward, I mean, as we said, when Mahomes sign this deal, I said, that is an unbelievably team friendly deal.  He will be underpaid quickly. And he is.  Now, I don't, I'm sure they're going to, you know, tear this contract up and give him something and extend it and all those things.  But even then, he'll probably still be underpaid. Yes, Mark.  Do you think this Kyle Shanahan situation might be like 20 dungeon in Tampa Bay where it's like you're on the cusp, but we need somebody to take us over the hump.  Like when Tim and Biggey John Groeden.  I don't know the mindset there at all, but I just, you know, the point I'm trying to make is that it feels like that window is wide open.  And then all of a sudden it's not wide open and there's maybe a crack in the window pane and then all of a sudden you're like,  Does McAfrey play?  This feels like this stays with him.  How long can George Kiddler go out there?  Debo gets banged up.  I, you, has got a long way back from an ACL.  Trent Williams, how long do you keep him?  I, I love Fred Warner.  I think he's a whole of favor.  You know, you're going to be able to keep these guys.  Yeah, Pauli.

Couple of phone calls then we'll talk to Kevin Malar from the MLB network.  The first one is the first one.  Yes, Paul.  I still have the pie in the face.  Oh, oh, if you'd like it.  Okay.  Are you ready?  Yes.  It's an NFL related.  Think about this.  Okay.  Here it is.  And I'll up the bet to I will take two pies and throw out one to the person who bets me.  Okay.  The next head coach of the Chicago Bears will be Ben Johnson of the Detroit Lions.  No doubt one of the first hires.  Okay.  Anybody want a piece.  And you get the field.  Every other person on there.  Including if they don't.  Correct.  If they don't fire their head coach.  Okay.  Does anybody want a piece of that with Ben Johnson, the Lions offensive coordinator?  Anybody?  It's a strong pick.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He'll be the leading candidate.  Although you can say.  Bellachak, but Bellachak.  But yeah.  You know, I'm trying to figure out if Bellachak coaches again.  And I said last year I didn't think he coached again.  But it because he's so successful in the media.  Now, I don't know if coming back to try to prove what Brady did when he went to Tampa Bay,  also to become the all-time victory leader in NFL history, passing Don Shula.  I don't know how important that is to it.  And I don't know if you'd get an honest answer from him, even though now he's media friendly.  But Mike Rable.  He's going to be out there.  But Ben Johnson turned down jobs or maybe scared some teams off because he did ask for a lot of money.  Like he wanted to be paid as one of the highest paid coaches in the NFL.  And Dallas to me would be interesting because Jerry is offensive minded.  And you got an offensive coordinator coming in there.  But if Chicago got him considering the way Detroit's offensive has been, that'd be a good  coup.  There.  All right.  Let me see.  Moiner, Arizona.  Hi, Mo.  What's on your mind today?

Adrian Brody won in what 2002 2003 for the pianist, and then he won last night for the Brutalist.  I think anytime there's anist at the end, that's when you got to watch out for Adrian Brody.  Representative. Thank you, sir. Thank you, Todd. Pauli came up with the great comp of McColley  Cawkin is Bobby Hurley, Kieran Cawkin is Danny Hurley. Try that out for size. Yeah, it's like McColley  Cawkin and Bobby Hurley had a lot of success a long time ago, and then their brothers come along in their  shadow, get out of their shadow, and create their own shadow. Kieran Cawkin wins for a real pain,  which I did really like the movie. I thought it was well done. A mediocre battle there is. I did not  like it all, although Zoe Seldano did win the best supporting actress, not surprised there,  and I liked to know her. And Mike and Madison are one of the best actress. I thought she was spectacular.  And really, the movie you can tell it's, you know, it's an indie film. It's low budget.  I don't know how they pulled her off. I think it was they shot it for $5 million, maybe less.  But and there's no big names in it, but all of a sudden you're watching and you're going, all right,  this is interesting. And then it gets out of pace where you're like damn slow down movie. Yeah,  Paulie. Pied of the face bat. This is long term. In the next decade, McColley Cawkin  wins an Oscar for either best actor or best supporting actor. I'll take that done. Yeah, I'll take that.  All right. Yeah. See you back here in 10. Okay.

Best of the weekend,  Warrior six or Saturday night featuring a rare junk by Steph Curry with Alan Iverson looking on. That was cool.  Also, Quentin Grimes is fairly 44 points, six boards, three steals in a home win over Golden State. That was fun.  Worst of the weekend, though, after a home loss Saturday to Texas Tech and a poor performance Kansas's  Zic Mayo, target of racist comments and threats of violence on social media. Can we stop the nonsense already.  Sorry, a team didn't win. Maybe you lost a bet. But enough for that garbage. Yeah.  Uh, seat and best of worst. I best of the weekend Michigan got punched in the face by  Illinois and lost by 20. That was great. I love seeing that. My worst of the weekend, I watched a lot of  the combine this weekend. And for most of the 40 yard dashes, they're like, wow, this isn't really that important.  Because we know this guy could fly. We know this guy, whatever this in that, but you want, but for some people  is super important. Like, uh, Tess Johnson from, uh, Oregon. They basically set up his whole  performance by being like, look, this dude, he's like five nine or something like that. He's pretty small,  but they're like, he's here because he's super fast. And that's really the main reason that people are looking at him.  And he unfortunately ran two not great 40s that he came up far short of what not only was expected of him,  but what everybody knows he could do. So hopefully that doesn't cost him too much and people still look at him.  But there's a lot of hype around like, let's say he might, he got to get four two sub four two"

There you go. Dracking field, underrated sport. So Marvin kind of stole my thunder  on the best and worst of the week. You're last quality to the Brewers there. But going to the WNDA,  which we don't talk about too much on your show, on the worst was in a feces of color.  Because we can't entertain the team. We've been held in the game with a 50 point lead and leaving with the spring ankle.  Yeah, I know. I know. I never understand that. When you're watching, like, you know, the UConn women,  they could be up by 40 and some of their starters are still in and I just said, you know, you're  going to run the risk. Like, what are you doing? And Collier is really a wonderful player and should be the MVP.  Thank you, Kenny, for the phone call. Brian in San Antonio. Hi Brian.  Hey, good morning. Dan five foot six down to 185. I also have a best and best.  Might we can start on Thursday, Dan, and the best was just Thursday night football. Like an old friend  coming home. And it was awesome. Don't care. It was playing just wanted to watch it. My other best  of the weekend is a Denver Broncos locking up Zach Allen with a great contract for a guy who's been an  absolute beast on the team. The Broncos are like the anti cowboy Dan. They've done a fantastic job of locking  up their young guys in in certain, and sudden, the, well, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,  the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,  I think going back to bowls and some of those other guys, they're just doing a fantastic job.  Uh, have a high to the face bet for the boys. Okay. For the, okay.  For the generous. All right. Okay. Let's hear the band.  So I think one of the sneaky good pickups during the off season was in Miami Dolphins picking up Zach Wilson.  Uh, Broncos wanted to keep them, but he's going to be too expensive.

And then we went, wow. Okay. And then Marvin goes there is no way he could beat Zion Williamson in a race.

Well,  a lot of it was he was predicting what the play was going to be. I think, you know, the further you get away  from the game, it feels like the less in touch you are with the game. Like you have to re-dedicate yourself  even more so. You have to learn who these new players are or new coaches are. Instead of, hey, I played  with that guy two years ago, I'm well aware of who he is or what he does. And I would just say it's dedication.  It's wanting to put in the time. And you can get by with a lot of things. But you know, you can't fool  a football fan. You just can't. And I think that's part of the problem. Maybe Tony hasn't  re-dedicated himself to wanting to be great again. Jordan and Wisconsin. Hi, Jordan, what's on your  run? Hey, Dan, first time long time, 62, 2, 30.

They've got to come around and just change everything with music.  They've been through the whole rhythm and blues thing out the window from Elvis and the blues thing everybody else.  And they started off with some rock and roll, but then they implemented orchestral music.  They implemented shit toors.  The Sergeant Pepper's album is the most unique album.  And it's probably best out of my life.  So to compare a haul and a boat.  And a beetle.  Are you crazy?  It's not even animal.  And I love the stones.  But what does they do?  They do a lot of other people songs.  A lot of old, muddy water.  Different kinds of like that.  They do a lot of blues songs.  Some by other guys.  That's what they're in.  Great musicians.  For your right.  Dan and the field just really did change everything like you talked about.  Yes, they changed fashion.  Hair style.  I mean, they were a complete wave.  And if you listen to the complexities of their music, I mean, it is.  It's mind boggling.  To do that over at eight or nine year period and have that impact.  I don't, I shouldn't be fighting a beetles fight here.  It's just, I hope that one day that you have an educated year that you understand just how great the beetles were.  That's all.  They've done it all.  Yes, Warren.  So with the beetles, it's objectively good music.  It's great music.  Okay.  Yes, absolutely.  They started out as a boy band."

He's on the PGA tour. He's on the European tour. Why? Why? And he's  not the face of the PGA. But they don't conflict. The G.P. World Tour doesn't conflict with the PGA  tour. Okay.

There's a bunch of those playing to pick up game.  You looked around to get one extra player.  I thought I was going to pick me because I was a biggest and it said they picked a little  black.  I bought a foot shorter than me.  So that's my one and only pseudo discrimination story.  I thought it was going to get to play with the piss and it didn't work out.  So, well, well, once again, blame you for racism.  I know.  Exactly.  Well, really, I'm calling.  I wanted to see if Marvin, any of you that are guys want to do a pie of the face bet.

What do you want to just stop throwing that?  That seems a little.  So I don't want to speculate.  Now, I mean, but it was an odd video that Luke after the game has got a beer in his  hand.  Michael, finally, former Mavericks works for the Mavericks.  Just walks up and grabs the beer and Luke has this like, can you believe he just did that?  Let me take a break.

The verdict goes doing good. We're hot with the way you  ended that last hour. Not sure you should have even showed up today. Whoa. Whoa, shot it. Todd there.  Yeah, a little man. Man, that's a list from Sean. Okay. That's messed up. Sean. You know what?  Just happened Tyler hung up on him because he made fun of you. How's got my back? He's also who let him on.  That's true. So. Yeah. Yeah. You're front. Yeah. Not really. He said he was going to talk in a normal voice about the  liquor. That's how he said he's going to say to me. Yeah. Oh, I know. I always feel bad when somebody's  sneaks through and then Tyler's like, I, he told me he was going to talk about something else. I go. Yeah.  By the way, the Lakers, they, one last night. In case you care, they came back from what 19 down beat the  bucks without LeBron in there. And they trail by 19 in the fourth quarter.

Hey, let's see. Love the, uh, I'm not  paying attention bit. Keep that up. It's the look on Dan's face every time this price list. Glad you're  appreciate the bet. And then, man, I got a high in the face that hopefully with Pauli and  Fritzie. I'm a New York giant fan. So I'm going to say the New York giants have a better record  than the Chicago Bears and again for Broncos, pie in the face. Okay. They're from both or one of them.  Whatever. Anybody want a piece of Jason and Nebraska? Todd, do you think the Broncos have a better  record than the giants? I don't feel good about that. I think they're going in the wrong direction for  well, maybe a couple years then they're going to turn it over. Well, the giants are in a wrong direction.  Denver could easily go 5 in 12. 11. I won't be shocked. Pauli, your Bears won 7 games last year. You're  going to bring in Caleb Williams. You got all this talent. And will they have a better record the Bears  then the giants? I don't feel good about this bet either, but I will take it for the fun.  All right. So there you go, Jason. Pauli says that he'll take the Bears over the giants. And then the  giants see here's another thing. The giants are kind of a wild card here too. Can they get into the top four  if they want to take a quarter back? What do they have the sixth pick overall? The Danny Dimes thing didn't go  well. I think they're worried about his health to start the season as well. And no sequin, Bartley,  which means he'll be even more exposed. But feels like the giants might try to hit the reset button as  well. And once again, JJ McCarthy is what, you know, I keep hearing because it feels like the top three  are solid depending on what order then it's JJ McCarthy. And then it feels like a few more picks. And then  you have Bonyx, Michael Panics Junior. That's what it feels like. But it feels like there's three  maybe JJ McCarthy's in that now it's four. But then after that, Panics and Bonyx. Yes,  yes, Martin. Do you think Panics and Nick's go to a team in the later round? Yeah. Okay, later in the  first round? Yeah. Kind of watch behind maybe Josh Allen or Jared golf? Like that, Lee? I don't know what  the Raiders are going to do. Because you always have to go, okay, who needs who has to have a quarterback?  Denver has to have a quarterback.

Okay, we had Marvin who's saying a Stevie Wunderson and then Todd's saying a Lewis  Capaldi.  Yes, someone you loved.  So I think there's a difference in better singer better performance.  It felt like Marvin wasn't sure of himself, but might have been a better singer.  Fritzzy, he's the whole package.  I'm too sure of my stuff.  Yeah, the problem is he's got his hands on his package.  That's he's the whole package.  That's the problem.  He's saying with his hands down his pants.  Too much a Todd's package.  Yes.  That's how I hit the high notes.  I still don't know why you had your hands in your pocket.  I was nervous.  I didn't know what to do with my hands.  There was no like mic to hold because it was on the stand.  But the entire 10 minutes when you sang two songs with Jerry's record, your hands are in your  pocket.  I was brave enough to sing two songs yet.  I was so nervous.  I couldn't get my hands out of my pocket.  I don't know.  I don't think I can use the word brave.  The crowd was brave.  That's it.  They were a lot more brave enough to sit through that.  Okay.

Maybe you become most valuable Danette and the reward is for new tires and a pie to the face.  Or you don't get the pie to the face because that's one of the rewards of getting MVD.  You get to not get the pie.  Oh no, no.  It doesn't work.  It doesn't.  How about we go around the room.  The most must win game of the weekend.  Okay, I'm taking Notre Dame off the board.  I think Notre Dame that they have to win that game.  You can put Ohio State in there because you know what they just did or happened to them at that place with Michigan.  And now you got a really good Tennessee team in town.  So Todd, the most must win game of the weekend.  The seven and seven at Lantefalkans bench Kirk cousins for 10X.  They'd better win at home versus the two in 12 giants.  I like that.  That's a good choice.  See, no Connor, most must win game of the weekend.  Yeah, most must win Danpoon to Sleega, Dortman.

I don't  haven't been working on anything, but you weren't working on things before. Okay. I don't want to say never  attended things because I enjoyed making people laugh, but I got to get the left part going to make people  laugh. Don't just stand there on stage, Tom. It's been a 10 year break for you. It's been a long,  been a long hiatus for me. Dylan's done some research, which is shocking, but, um,  Dias Dylan, the, how, how do the prop bets with the overunders of appearances by Taylor Swift on camera,  count if she arrives at the stadium before the game or they show her after the game, does that count in  the prop bet of over under five and a half appearances? So I reached out to our steams colleague,  Sammy P, again, okay. And he clarified it's during the game. The broadcast start to finish during the game.  The line is five and a half. I've been having it. And you're taking the over, even though you wanted the  under, but you took it for a pie to the face bet. Yeah. I like the under, but I took the over, look,  50, 50 odd more or less. Um, and I'm a, I'm a, I'm a sportsman. By the way, Sammy P is a professional  gambler. He joined us on the podcast yesterday. He had an interesting philosophy of betting early in the  this week and at the end of this week. And then you can bet over the following week. Is that what is  philosophy was or was the other way around there? Do it. So you want to, if you want overs on props,  take them early because I was like conventional thinking is people lean towards taking the over on  those bets. Okay. Then later in the week, you know, even Super Bowl Sunday, take the under's  once the lines have been picked up. Yeah. Yeah. There was a lot of great information. Dampatric.com,  the Dampatric takes a gamble. And also, Shay and Irving with his reaction to Brian Schott and Heimer,  the name and countless new head coach. Um, and it's not safe for work. If you're in the car with  the family with kids, just letting, you know, the asphalt. I heard a chunk of a betting show. I'm not going  to name names or networks the other day. And the, the expert on air quoting said, they hesitate on  over under is until they know what the weather is. For for instance, they want to wait and see what's going  on a New Orleans before they make their bed. I'm like, well, this is a clearly a joke. And they were  not kidding.

I want to put some clarity to  some thanks here because my wife's been getting ripped off. She called you guys in Norlins.  Fans. She was almost dying in the hospital last year and our kid was coloring and  being in the sad of the day. And that's what motivated her to make you a song.  So she wasn't in Tassel's or feathers. We don't live in Las Vegas. She was. However,  she was. However, wearing marbs hands t-shirt. And let me tell you, bro,  where my wife put on your hands. She's your hands. We call it the Pandora stretch.  We're thinking about going down to the combine. Helping some of them little hand kids out.  But yeah, just some clarity. And then if I have time, I've got a pie to the face because she was  wearing marbs shirt. Pie to the face bet from marb. Okay. So Pandora was a blue singer and cleavant.  So based off of the song, we're going to send you guys a care package from our farm.  And I was going to put a picture of Pandora and I'm below in there. And based off of her song,  did I marry a beautiful woman of color? Or is she just another James and Virginia?  Oh, wow. Okay. I guess marb and you have to make this pie to the face bet. Did Sean Mary a woman  who is African-American or sounds that way when she sings. But he said, a woman of color.  You didn't say black. Okay. Sean, are you saying a woman of color or a woman who's black?  I thought that was the same thing. Okay. Oh, okay. All right. So marb, there you go.  So it's like, uh, yeah. Pipes. Pipes. Perfect. Those aren't the same things everybody. Okay. But so, uh,  black woman. Correct. African-American. Okay. So you got a pie to the face bet if she, well wait.  I think he just basically said that she's African-American. It's on James and Virginia where we found out that he's white.  It is black history, mother, Marvin. No one covers it like us. No. Yeah. He's, yes, Todd.  So marb and after guests and it means rolling, it's a pie in the face. I happen to be. I guess I'm going to go  that she's African-American. How's that? Yes, he. I don't know how it would work if he said,  well, you black or woman of color and then you said to her, I think thing.  Not on other than it is. Yes. Well, baby, you know what? I mean, same thing. Yeah. Yeah.  Oh, she's a woman, not of color. Oh, you think that, uh, Pandora is not a woman of color.  Or the color's white. Oh, okay. I had Sean. So Marvin is saying that your wife is white.  Why, I was going to put a picture in our care package and make you reveal it. Well, you can do it right now  because Marvin is already made his guess. She's white.  Well, congratulations. Thank you, Marvin. Congratulations. I do appreciate that.  Sean is like, but babe, I gotta tell you, you sound pretty black with the second.  I've been like a fool these guys. I'm telling you, there's like a hint of blackness when you're saying,  I'm going to try it. Yes, Marvin. In the references we were using when she was singing was  Lilith there in four non-blond. Oh, I'm not sure that's black. Well, I had tassels and feathers.  So that's different. That was Las Vegas. I didn't know they were from Tahoe, Lake Tahoe.  Which, by the way, Lake Tahoe has plenty of casinos and possibly Burlesque as well. I, I've been to Tahoe,  but I didn't see any Burlesque. But that's Pandora from Lake Tahoe. I like the song.  I like it. I do. Now we're going to get now. We more likely to get more statted the day,  renditions or less because of how we've treated Pandora here.

I don't know if the lakers are going to feel obligated to keep him.  I don't know if LeBron's going to let his son be cut.  That would be embarrassing.  So, I don't, I don't know.  Yeah.  But what?

He needs to be seasoned here.  Uh, he's not, he's not ready for it.  Yeah.  I don't want him to be embarrassed again and Steven A Smith to call the, you know, the services.

Um, I just, I think he probably wanted to best guys to never make an all start to.  All right.  Thank you, Miles.  I didn't think I'd get a Montaelist.  Uh, mentioned today on the show.  We were do.  Yeah.  I've been waiting for it.  Finally, game.  It's about time.  Who is the best player to never make an all start to?  Oh, we're going to need a week on that.  Yeah.  I got Montaelist 05 to 2017.  He had four seasons where three seasons were average 24 or more points.  Hey, yeah.  No all start.  Yes, Marvin.  off the top of my head.  I'm going to say Mike Bibi.  Mike, maybe never made an all start to.  I don't think he did.  No.  Do not Crawford.  Did he make an all start?  Nope.  Hmm.  Okay.  Yeah.  I wouldn't need a little more time to do.

I would be willing to personally fly out to give Marvin that pie to the face.  Wow.  But there you go.  Who's a shot fired?  And then second and more importantly, everybody talk about how Luke and Carl Anthony Towns are bad.  I've defenced some other guys.  And we know they have like six months to work on that and they've designated the 16 coaches.  And just all of a bunch of people can't they work on that until like next season and get better on defense.  I don't think Carl Anthony Towns can be a good defender.  I don't think so.  Not at this point.  He's been in the lead for 10 years.  Yes, he.  But there isn't a way to just like sort of the Bob's point, right?  Spend the summer working on just his positioning.  Like, hey, if you learn if you put your body here instead of there, that's all it is.  It isn't even necessarily like an effort thing.  It's more like an awareness thing, maybe.  You know?  Well, you have to want to play D-Sense.  First of all.  And I don't know how many guys go, especially if you're a score where you go.  I really want to be a little better defender.  I mean, does Jalen Brunson say that?  I mean, I can ding Carl Anthony Towns.  But Jalen Brunson, now you can say, well, he's short, but still there guys.  You know, don't have to be 65 to be a good defender.  But you got your stuck with Carl Anthony Towns for three more years.  Yes, Martin.  Only if the mix had a defensive mighty coach.  That's great.

But the thing that I really like the big change that's come out of that defense is that they used to all play like cover zero when they blitz like that.  And cover zero basically means no free safety, no depell.  You're one on one generally playing all the ball or bump and run.  But if you lose one on one that could be a 70 yard touchdown right and that that fear factor kept most teams out of trying to do that.  Now we're seeing a lot of that same thing in Minnesota basically had cut and half the number of covers zeroes that they had.  So now they've got a team that can play three deep zone behind it.  Only two guys underneath and still rush five and come after and try to confuse your quarterback.  But they don't have the risk of giving up the 70 yard touchdown.  And so that ability to create the constant feel of pressure.  And the game we did the other night, Joe Flacco could feel pressure on almost every play.  But he didn't have the option of attacking them with home run balls when they're basically attacking him with home run defenses.  Good to talk to you. We'll be watching Sunday night.

So I'm going to go Illinois fighting a line of verses in Indiana, Illinois's ranked ninth.  If they can get a couple more wins before that Ohio State game, they can afford a loss to a high-o state.  And maybe sneak in a place, but they have to win before that.  So I have to be in the end.  Todd, the most most win game of the weekend.

They do not want to lose and they should not lose to them and they can't be Owen 3.  I always like when a quarterback throws an interception in the announcer goes, he'd like to have that one back.

The Chicago Bears.  They got a game at home against the Cowboys and Ben Johnson just called out your team for lack of effort.  It has to be the chiefs because we're looking at the bigger picture of the chiefs being back as the chiefs,  winning a division, making the playoffs being a super bull contender.  Yes, Todd.  If the bears don't give a championship caliber effort against the Cowboys,  what are we going to say about Chicago and Monday?  That they didn't give a championship caliber performance.  You're right.  Sounds like guns ready to take them to the UFC title game.  You're one.  Okay.  All right.  You better worry about your Broncos against you.  I have some concerns about that game.  They need to win that.  All right.  First place after three weeks.  They have to see what this day in sports history.  You know, the Texans are getting into the most most win game of the weekend as well.  This day in sports history, Paul.  1999, Sammy Sosa became the first Major League ball player to hit 60 homones twice.  And this is a fun one.  Well, not for him.  Tom Gamboa of the Kansas Royals.  First base coach I think was attacked by a man and a son at Comiski Park standing there for first base.  They two, the two men were charged with battery.

Thank you, Joe.  Yeah, I saw that the back room guys, Dylan went out and did some shopping during the show.  I, I look in the bag and it's like five containers of whipped cream and there's pie filling and there's crust in there.  It seems like a little excessive, but there it is.  If you're watching on peacock, the the bag is there with all lovely.  Yeah, they're going to whip up the pie. Who do you want to hit you in the face with the pie?  I'm going to go Dylan, actually.  Oh, you want Dylan.  I actually, you know, what what it bill part sells about if you want to make the groceries and you got to have you could pick out the groceries.  Okay.  Well, then the little bit you I don't know.  Are you quoting him exactly?  Something about picking out the groceries.  Yeah, like if I got to if I got to play the guys, you know that you're giving me let me you know, you know, have some say and pick them out.  Now let's go get them guys.  Yeah.  If I'm going to cook them here, let me pick out the groceries.  That's something that it is.  Very much.  All right.  Andrew and Texas. I Andrew, which on your mind.  DPA. Thank you for having me on a long time listener.  First on caller.  I just wanted to say I agree with you on the Tom Brady situation.  And I don't fault any team for wanting to limit him or exclude him from those meetings.  And but also on the other side of it.  It didn't look like it helped a whole lot because the quarterback situation on the Raiders are pretty weak right now.  Yeah, but that's not the point.  The point is that does Tom have access.  Will he have access and how does the use that access?  But yeah, you're right. Last night Tom helping chip Kelly call plays for Genosmith didn't go well."
"Tue, 11 Mar 2025","Hour 3 – Gerrit Cole Gets Tommy John Surgery, Louis Riddick",13:59,Other,Paulie Pabst,Pie,Andrew bets that more running backs will be taken in the first round of the NFL draft than quarterbacks.,Paulie Pabst,Other,Paid,2025-03-11,"If I could go back and do a doover, I would say no replay.  Let it happen. I think the majority would go with that.  You still have to get it right. Yeah, but I think people love the human element and they think it'll balance  the balance itself out. You get a couple. You lose a couple. I don't want the human elephant.  El, El, it might be the human elephant in the room. I'd say the viewing experience has been hurt because of the delays.  It adds drama sometimes. You're like, look at the replay. You're screaming at the TV. So that helps too.  I think it's, I agree. It's a necessary evil. It's entertainment. It's impacted a lot of games.  A lot of sports. The fact that, you know, when we didn't have it, we didn't know what we didn't have.  And then you realize that you're like, how many moments in sports history would have been changed?  If you had replay. Now everybody's going to go back to the immaculate reception.  Instant replay wouldn't have changed. They wouldn't have overruled that. The call on the field would have  stood because you still can't tell when you watch that. But I think for the most part,  it's been a, it's been a good-ish thing for sports. Be weird to not have replay watching again.  Let me get to Andrew and Washington and then we'll take a break. We'll talk to,  let's see, Lewis Ridic from the mothership's going to stop by. Hey Andrew.  Good morning, Dan. And thanks for taking my call. Just having a little thing on the Lakers. I think  the growing is good for the Lakers. I disagree with Mark and Drew with Ollie. You can't prove a  strain growing. Sort of like a stomach flu. And so it gives a little bit of rest before the playoff  push. I don't think it matters where we go. I think the Lakers will end up in the finals as far as  whatever their seating is in the playoffs. I do have an NFL draft pie to the face that with Polly. We've  done this two or three years. My bet, if Polly once would take it is that more running back, we take it in the  first round than quarterbacks. And if there's a tie, we both take a pie. All right. Right now it feels like  there's two quarterbacks that you can pencil in first round and two running backs right now.  So Andrew, are you taking running backs?  Yes, I think there'll be more running backs in quarterbacks taking in the first round of this year in a  fell draft. All right. All I will take that. I think he's riding the wave of running back to high.  There may be two. I think someone's going to jump back into the first round and draft Jackson Dart.  But just so you know, if you tie, tie goes to the runner. I go, it's no.  It tack goes to the pie. You both get pies. So I have to win to unpy my ass. You do.  I'm by the way, the weather is nice. And a front row in a back row guy have pies. I think Friday we should  we should do that. Pie equals U 2 squared. Okay. See what I did with that thought. Very clear. Yeah.  Thank you. Weather permitting. Okay. Paulie, what's the forecast for Friday? You said the over under was  49.5 degrees for pie weather. Yes. Hi, a 51 on Friday. Yes. Yes. It's going to be pie day.  We're going to do this on pie day. See what? Yeah. It's a meat. A meat pie. What, Marvin? It's 50 degrees.  Yeah. I said 49 and a half. That's not warm enough in O'Pine. Yeah. It is. No. Come on.  Oh, I'm soft. Yes. You want to get no argument. It's not a polar plunge.  It's a pie to the face. Yes, Dylan. What if Marvin's allowed to sit in his car and crank the heat and he tastes the pie?  Yeah. You like you'd like to do it. Nice recovery, Dylan. Yes. We can do that. I'm in. All right. So pie to the pie to the face on Friday.  Todd. That's. Okay. Well, take a break.

It's a way more involved discussion with dozens of examples of this going wrong.  Marvin, how about we post that on the newsletter social media?  We'll put that out.  And when you're stubborn and you don't want to accept that you're wrong and you just kind of go all in out of it and it continues to just take a deeper whole type of that.  Uh, let me see.  Toby in California.  Hi, Toby.  Thanks for holding what's on your mind today.  Hey, Dan, one to give you a best of the weekend.  That's where the weekend is on Friday night.  I got to umpire the Savannah bananas at Angel Stadium.  And if you have a chance to go highly recommended,  most fun I've ever had on a baseball field.  And then I wanted to talk to you about a few months ago,  you talked about connections with your fans.  And I feel like I have a connection with the show more than anyone.  Um, my, with my kids, I do best and worst every single day.  And then I ask him every single day.  Um, what they learned today.  And then every time I pick up my daughters from school because I may,  I'm usually a podcast listener.  They say, do we get a listen of podcasts again of Dan Patrick?  And they know all the status of the day songs.  Love your show.  Love you guys a more than just a sports show.  You guys are a, a connection show.  And I appreciate all that you do for us.  Thank you, Toby.  And one other thing that you should always ask your children who has it better than we do.  And then you want them to say, no, body.  Bob and Montana.  Hi, Bob.  We got your video.  Bob took a pie to the face.  He thought we were winning the sports Emmy.  And Bob, thank you for, uh, but I guess paying up your bet.  Hey, hey, no problem there, D.P.  Hey, well, uh, just the last my thunder there.  I was going to call in which you guys are happy.  Nine anniversary for sausage off day.  But that's fine.  Uh, speaking of thunder on whom right into my second topic in the spirit of in the spirit of me losing to my Emmy.  Uh, losing the money he losing to the nuggets two years ago in Marvin took me up on a pie that a face spent.  Then I'll just take the pace or straight up right now again.  So K.C. I'm hoping Marvin will take me up again.  But if you don't want to one of the other guys or yourself as well.  All right, Bob.  Marvin will take you up on that.  Our Marvin's got a case.  Thank you.  Thank you, Bob.  Paul in Indiana.  Hi, Paul.  What's on your mind?  Oh, Dan.  Thanks for taking my call.  Yeah.  Six foot, 170.  Oh, then a couple years ago with this line thought it's perfectly again.  What I'd like to say.  Uh, I knew the pastures were going to win.  Because I could fill it in my plums.  They turned a nice pace or blueish view.  Time to pick him to the farmers market, which is in the final foam.  Thank you, Paul. Congratulations.  Call back in a couple of weeks.  Oh, no.  Let me know how your plums are doing.  Dave and Denver.  Hi, Dave. What's on your mind today?  What up, D.P. Yeah.  Six foot, 175.  Um, so this is the first time in D.P. show history that the Seattle manners are going to get to  the best of the weekends.  Uh, the first one is, uh, call young, getting called up and get in a walk off in the bottom of the 11th.  And then the second one is, Cal Raleh, he is 23rd Dinger, which is Typhor 1st in the MLB.  I know, go figure the guy who has more home runs than Judge and so A. O' Tani is Cal Raleh.  And if you go back since the start of the 2023 season, he's hit 11 go ahead home runs in the 7th inning or  later.  That's four more than any other player over that span.  Woo, woo, woo.  Now, stop the day.  Stop the day.  Stop the day.  Stop the day.  Stop the day.  This is the stop the day.  Brought you by.  Panning the American, the official trading cards of the Dan Patrick shows Zack and Knoxville.  Welcome back. Zack.  What's on your mind?  Hey, D. B. Thanks for taking my call. I hate to do this. I didn't know it was going to be with Marvin, but I do agree with the Andrew McCutchen take, but I was actually calling for a pie to the face for the Pacers to win straight up.  So, is Marvin one of Michael D. Blade down?  Do you want to double down there?  Yeah, man.  Okay.  I'm done.  Yeah.  Wait, so you're saying Andrew McCutchen is in the hall of very good.  All of very good.  I know you wanted MVP, but I think we're being a little too lenient with very good.  Yes, Paul.  I have Andrew McCutchen's career. He came out hot.  Five all star games from age 24 to 28.  Okay.  And then since the age of 28, he has not made an all star game or been at top ten MVP candidate.  Okay.  He was cruising his first seven years.  How many hits does he have?  I've got 2,200, 2,73 hitter.  Yeah.  Okay.  He's not on the cusp of the Hall of Fame.  He's the hall of good, which is in a different location.  Yes, it is.  Marvin.  So the Hall of very good is for guys like Dale Murphy, Steve Garvey.  Guys that get 73% of the votes at the Hall of Fame.  Yeah.  Okay.  Would you put Andrew McCutchen in with Dale Murphy?  No.  Okay.  Steve Garvey?  No.  Okay.  That's all.  We solved it.  It's done.  Yes, Tom.  I was just looking at a list.  Kirk Kipsen.  Mark Shava's Tim Sam and never made an all star team.  Blie 11.  Fergie Jenkins Robin Yound.  Actually, Blie 11 and Fergie only two robbing young three.  So does that affect the decision on the cuts of his five all star?  Robin Yound had 3,000 hits.  That is true.  If you take the 3000 hits away on the other side.  I don't think we can do that.  That is the real star team with 3,000 hits."

After that, they've been minus 42.  And you just lose your offensive coordinator.  Yes, Marvin.  If you're the bears, you just say to Bill Bellachek or Mike Vrable or Ben Johnson, name your  price.  Well, I don't know if you say name your price.  But I, I think with Vrable and Ben Johnson, you gotta be careful.  I mean, he wanted big, big numbers there and scared off some teams.  I think he wanted 15 million dollars a year.  He's going to be probably even more valuable if the lions go to the Super Bowl when the Super Bowl,  now all of a sudden we're talking 18, 20 million dollars.  But you're the bears.  You haven't done anything.  You don't spend the lot.  You want to bring him in?  Mike Vrable, I don't see Bill Bellachek doing it.  I don't, I don't, I've said it.  I don't see Bellachek coaching anymore.  I think he's got a good gig, good gigs.  And, you know, he's able to enjoy his life.  It's like Nick Sabin.  I never thought I would think that I would outlast Nick Sabin with him coaching and me doing what  I'm doing.  But the stress, the portal, NIL, all of that drove him out.  And Fritz is the only reason that I would stop doing what I'm doing.  Like he's my NIL in my transfer portal.  But I'm going to still stick through it.  I think he's shared.  Now, for the next couple of years, I'm going to stick through it.  Yeah, try to do that.  Put up with Todd.  Let me get a couple of phone calls in here.  Noah in North Carolina.  I know what's on your mind.  Well, so down in the day and that, 6-1-1-80.  Man, I've always wanted to do that.  OK.  So, how did the fake fake pie that face that given I'm a Ravens fan?  Well, I am terrified of this dealer right now.  And I see them making it to the Super Bowl.  The moment I'm there carrying the veteran team that have their defenses on real and  Russell Wilson's plan, like, just better than I feel like I've seen him as Seattle.  And he's really fun to watch.  Wait, wait, wait.  When it's slow down, no, slow down.  It's OK.  Steelers are playing pretty well in the last three games.  So, you've got the Steelers winning the Super Bowl.  You're going to the Super Bowl now.  No, the NFC has some contenders that I don't want to.  The AFC is brutal.  Wait, Todd, you're going to take him up on this?  Yeah, if the Steelers are not going to the Super Bowl.  OK, I will take that.  Noah, for it's he's going to take you up on the pie to the face, Ben.

And hey, as the great Ole Miss baseball legend, Tim Elco said, don't let the grabs get hot in  route to a national title.  Keep an eye out on those Ole Miss rebels.  We get the right path that defensive line eats like that.  Ole Miss has a real shot.  Keep an eye out on him.  All right.  I will, Michael.  Thank you.  Keep an eye out on him.  Yes, Paul.  Ole Miss has a friendly end of the season.  They got Florida, which shouldn't be a problem.  Mississippi State.  Which should not be a problem.  And then the SEC title game.  Okay.  Got to keep an eye out on them.  Got to keep an eye out on him.  Time to play the NFL Jersey sales game NFL Jersey sales game.  This just in, Dan, these are the top 10 Jersey sales in the NFL from April 1st into last week.  So individuals, not team.  Correct.  Okay.  There are 10 names on there.

Every venue has certain things that at certain ways and times in the contest can create an  advantage.  That really goes on the category of home to a mid-range.  And so usually, and that's the case with us, that if there's a field or in the case that  your home field, which it is of the Dallas Cowboys, it should be an advantage to the home  team.  So I don't want to adjust it for one reason is because it is an advantage to us.  He just can't take the L.  Just say, hey, it affected us.  Normally, I think this affects the opposing team.  We plan accordingly.  We did this strategically.  It didn't work out CD loss the ball in the sun.  Okay.  But he is not going to admit that it hurt his team.  He made a mistake.

An elderly person.  It's just circling team sometimes you're doing it by color or mascot, and all of a sudden, one  of your wild guesses is making it into the sweet 16 or the elite.  It's just a fun easy thing to do.  It's a piece of paper you can walk around with and update with little checks and  X's based on what happens to the cost of the day.  It's just it's just a fun easy thing to look at and play with.  By the way, this fritzie do this to you guys where he sent me an email.  There was no text in the email, but the subject of the email said, will you please fill out a bracket again this year and be an  art tournament?  Like what is that fritzie?  I've done that many times and Paul, especially says, you know, has told me on many occasions,  sometimes it doesn't all show up on the screen or on the phone.  And Mike Toreco used to call me SL Fritz, single line fritz.  Because I put it in the subject line.  I guess it was subject line.  But there's nothing in the email.  It's just all in the subject line, Paul.  In all seriousness, Todd and I've been working together a long time.  He puts long email texts into the subject line, like you said, and nothing in there and it gets cut off.  I've asked him at least 200 times directly.  Can you put this in the body of the email?  It's easier for us to see in consumer.  And I don't think he's hurt.  Why don't you do it Fritzie?  I don't know.  I've just, I might do get to bother anybody to be a hindrance or a difficult.  I just sometimes it's just easier to type a few words.  And I don't realize sometimes I go shockingly long-winded.  And if you write too many words in the subject line, then you're not going to be able to see the whole thing.  And then it's just easy to type a few words, almost like a text message as an email into that one line and send it.  Sounds like you should, like there's things that you should get punished for.  Like you should get a pie to the face the next time you do that.  Because you got to learn.  Like you got to learn one way or the other.  Hey, speaking of learning, we are going to learn a ton.  Does your team need a quarterback?  Because guess what?  A lot of them do.  Yeah, it's giants, cults, Steelers, Raiders, a Miss and some.  Greg Cocell is the best in the business.

Listen to Family Secrets on the I-Heart Radio app, Apple Podcasts, or wherever you get your podcasts.  The social media trend that's landing some Gen Zers in jail.  The progressive media darling who's public meltdown got her fire.  I'm going to take Francesco off the network entirely.  The massive TikTok boycott against Target that makes no actual sense.  And we'll continue getting stuff from Target, and I will continue to not pay for it.  And the Magga influencers whose trip to the White House ended in embarrassment.  So refreshing to have a press secretary after the last few years who's both intelligent and articulate.  You won't hear about these online stories in the mainstream media, but you can keep up with them and all the other entertaining and outrageous things,  happening online in media and in politics with the Bradvests as everyone podcasts hosted by me, Brad Palombo.  Every day of the week, I bring you on a wild ride through the most delu-lu takes on the internet,  criticizing the extremes of both sides from an independent perspective,  joining in on the insanity and listen to the Bradvests as everyone podcast on the iHeart Radio app, Apple Podcasts, or wherever you get your podcasts.  Try to sneak in a few phone calls.  What we learn, Mr. James Sports History, let me see.  Oh, see, and brought this up, I think, last hour, where we heard from Aaron Glenn.  He's the new head coach of the jets.  And this is sort of the tone that he has, the bervato when he goes to the microphone that he thinks are changing with the jets.  I understand the reaction of the players, but I will say this.  Every decision that man moves you make is to win into win now.  So I understand it, but again, listen, this is not going to be the last decision I made, right?  That's not going to get this going to upset some people.  That's okay, right?  But as men we talk about it, we make sure we keep it in house that we're going to continue to do.  And then, Satan said he would take a pie to the face that he would take a ball to the balls.  If Robert Sala when he was sworn in as the jet head coach didn't sound or have a similar message.  So we went back and found when Robert Sala was introduced as the jet head coach.  To our organization, didn't use to the mantra, all gas, no break.  When we talk about all gas, no break, we're not talking about effort on the field.  We're talking about the process at which we do things.  We're talking about the way we prepare, the way we wake up every single morning, the way we rehab, the way we communicate, the way we speak to one another.  Can I tell you enough about how excited I am to work with this entire jet organization and understanding that when we wake up in the morning,  we will all from top down, step on the pedal and find a way to get somewhat better than we were when we woke up.  But understanding that the all gas, no break.  Maybe not as fiery as Aaron Glenn.  Well, that's about 90 seconds of a 90 minute introductory press conference.  Literally no breaks.  And he's also reading off of a teleprompter there.  He was.  Yeah, he's reading off of a teleprompter.  Oh, week.  Because they are or he's incredibly good at looking the camera just right down the barrel.  I can't believe they'd have a teleprompter for a coach.  I'm quite sure if you look at the beginning of it, they are they each of the three people up on the days.  Read a prepared statement, but none of them are looking at the paper.  They're all looking straight ahead.  Oh, that's a funbler words a little bit.  I think that's part of the prepared statement part.  Yeah.  That is bad.  I mean, it's a football team.  Okay, we're here to play football.  You can't script it.  I think you kind of can't do the whole game as scripted really.  Well, if you know what I mean.  Oh, yeah."

Yes, Marvin.  Seen said the cheese had no hope.  That's true.  You did.  You knew it.  Yes, yes, Paul.  I think a lot of people said the Saints were not competitive this year, going into the season.  I know they've only won five, but before the season, no one likes the Saints.  But they weren't going to make the playoffs.  What I'm saying is, we wrote them off.  Oh, yeah.  They got five wins and maybe they found their quarterback.  But nobody said what the Saints are going to make the playoffs.  It's probably five, six teams, which is, you know, that's what you want.  Now, the other sports don't necessarily have that.  Yes, Marvin.  Giants and Jets.  Man, the quarterback rating for both of those, the QBR for the quarterback yesterday, I think  they combined for like six.  Get the quarterback rating was six.  And this is Jackson Dart not a backup till backup, till a backup.  Yes, Paul.  Jackson Dart was seven of 13 with 33 yards passing and one pick.  His quarterback rating was four point seven.  And then the judge quarterback, look, cook.  I think his quarterback rating was three.  That's down right.  Brady Cook, though, he lit it up.  He was 22 of 35, one interception.  So guess not that bad.  I mean, those are essentially Philip River, same numbers from the other day.  We were like, is this a best story of the year?  It was amazing.  We don't feel it.  We just did.  Same numbers.  See.  Fritzi is getting a pie coming up in about 35 minutes.  He lost the bet with a.  He got 13 points in the Broncos at home and lost that bet because they lost by 14.  That's just amazing that he said that they would win by 14.  Yeah, Marcus and Jackson.  Now we did that.  So Todd getting a pie to the face and no, I'm not taking a pie to the face today because Todd  screwed it up on Friday.  Pied day.  You made the mistake.  You didn't hit me with the pie.  I had nothing to do with you.  There was no cowardice.  There was nothing other than me losing track of the time and not hitting you on camera.  Your clock management was terrible.  Beyond terrible.  Yes, Martin.  Going back to watching that segment at the end and hearing weeks and everyone else saying,  hey, no.  Like hearing weeks, you usually hear him attend a five or 30 minutes.  The cameraman normally doesn't talk.  They're not supposed to.  But he gives us time cues because we were outside we couldn't see the clock.  He would be like 60 and then it would be 30 and then he was like, hit him.  So the cameraman was actually saying, and we got to 10.  I took off my glasses so Todd was going to hit me with the pie.  He was like, okay, go ahead.  Close my eyes.  All of a sudden, it's five.  Todd hit him.  Yes, Todd.  That was just giving you a cue that our guest has been.  Oh, okay.  I went hand, hand, hand, hand.  This is, I have it.  It's something to say.  Thumb is.  Okay.  Thank you.  Nate Burlson's busy guy.  I'm going to fail.  Christmas game day.  And that'll be on Netflix.  So you'll be in the booth for the Cowboys and the Commanders.  You know, these games sound good when the season comes out.  Nate, where you go, man.  Cowboys and the Commanders here.  All right.  Let me hear you sell it.  Well, listen, you're right.  Initially, you know, they reached out and they said, this is going to be the Cowboys,  Commanders on Christmas day.  I'm thinking, oh, wait.  We got it.  And if he's the rivalry, this is going to be one of the biggest games of the year.  That press got there fighting for a chance to make a super boy run.  Game of Thrones, riding everybody.  Just how good he is at the quarterback position."

You could put together a hell of a team with just the International guys. Yes. Janis. Luca,  Joel and bead. Yeah. But I mean still. I mean he's. Kyrie. Could go that way if you want. Oh that's true. Yeah.  I think my starting five you're going to you're going to have problems dealing with that. And I might  tell them guys we really want to win. So you're going to you're going to play you're going to play a lot more.  We're going to win this game. I'd be interested at that. Yes. Paul. Do we get Canada? Yeah. So it would be  Canada, Latin America. Yeah. Would be with USA. No. No. Oh, so that's why I said what about why  would Canada be part of USA? Are you doing North America? I was thinking about it. Well they're  the 50 first state. So we just sort of assume that like everything on this side it's kind of ours. I mean  Canada would help us really when you're looking at it. It's kind of all ours. Canada is not going to be with us.  We don't need it. Marvin just said the United States doesn't need Canada with their basketball  talent. I'm saying the rest of the world would gladly take SGA. Yes, Mark. But what I'm saying is  you're taking away all star spots from guys that had all star seasons. Like I said in a Josh Giddie  in Bonyan, Bondana, Vige is going to make all star. Why are you picking those guys?  Could you have to fill out the roster in an actual guys? I know but you didn't go like bull bull. You  went Josh Giddie. Would Josh Giddie's more likely to make the all-sight team in bull bull? I know.  And he's actually a pretty good player. Yeah, he's not all star player though. Josh Giddie? Correct. He's a  good player. He is? He's a good player. That's the only reason I was saying. All right. You forgot when  B2. Yeah, see if you're not, we're gonna bring that on in a second. Come on. You were safe, you were safe.  I mean wait, you're gonna deal with that threat line. Come on. The Americans are going to get busy. Oh my god.  Pied of the face? In an actual pie of the face. Apple pie for me.  It's technically if you're calling it the Americans that could. I'd get a screw to them.  I'm flipping Marvin for apple pie. I think that'd be awesome. Okay, facing Tate. I'm not  scared nobody on that other side. No. Is there a more just respected player in the NBA? It feels like  then Jason Tate him. That we don't let him into the special club. He's not in with Joker and  Janice and you know those guys who got their title. He's got 70 playoff wins already. You're not even 27. Yes,  more. He also said the mentioning Olympics also. Well. But his numbers are great. He's plays on a great team.  They play in the Eastern Conference or the NBA finals every year. He's never finished top three for MVP.  But if and it feels like he gets disrespected. Now they are trying to get like commercials for him.  You know, they're trying to make him a little bit more than what he is. I just think he's one of those guys who  just a great player but doesn't have any buzz about him. You know, pulling. But those commercials don't  have a little kid at a store going. Hey, there's Jason Tate him from the Celtics where they have to  announce the person's name. He's not there. He's more famous than that. Hey, there's Jalen Brown. No,  that Jason Tate him. Oh, I get you guys mixed up all the time. Yes, sorry. But going back to the All Star  Roster there were 25 All Stars. 10 of the 13 from the East War American. Eight from the 13 on the West  where American. So the majority of All Star level players are Americans. The New York is a good  they're going to kill the International team. Kill like like Miami Heat Good Kill. Oh, no, it's"

It's tough to win consistently in the NFL.  And even when you have draft picks, how many times do you see a team and you're like,  Holy, they got like 17 draft picks. It doesn't mean they're any good at drafting.  Baltimore was always great and they were drafting at the end of the round.  They always somehow found players that fit their system.  And then when they had a higher draft pick, they didn't miss for a good portion of Aussie Newsom.  Is Aussie in the Hall of Fame?  Did he go in as a GM or I don't know is that GM and player?  But for some reason, I thought Aussie Newsom was, has he been up for the Hall of Fame?  If not, I'm nominating him for the Hall of Fame. Because if you factor in what you do as a GM,  he was great. How many GMs are in the Hall of Fame in the NFL? I don't know.  Is Jerry Jones going to be in the Hall of Fame for a GM?  It's great as he was telling us, you know, he's been Aussie got in in 1999.  There he is. Okay. Well, then he got in as a as a tight end.  Got not as a GM. I'm going to guess they didn't they didn't factor that in.  Contributions to the game. All right. A couple of phone calls here. By the way, Aaron Judged didn't  Homer. That's when you know you've gotten to a certain level where we're asking, oh, Yankees won.  Aaron Judge Homer. And sometimes it won't even be in that order to be a Judge Homer? Nope.  Or did Otani Homer or did he have a stolen base? Because he gets closer to maybe 45-45.  Mitchell in California. Hey, Mitch. What's on your mind today? Hey, Dan first time caller 510-140.  Law and Wolf former. Yeah, I'm by the way. In the Hall of Fame. Shout out to Marvin,  Team Small Hands, Shout out to Fritzie. Keep making them hit the row. I got a pie to the face offer for  Dan and the Danets of a potential Super Bowl matchup. Can't the city chief versus Green Bay Packers.  So lots of pieces of the pie. Well, that's not a stretch. That's that's not going on. Oh, limb.  Go back to Super Bowl 1 between those two. Yeah, Ron Wolf was great. I don't know. Just anybody want to  piece of that that green Bay versus Kansas City Chiefs. You guys get the field.  You're going to do the. Okay. Yeah, sure. All right. You got a bet.  Paul, you'll take you up on that that you have Kansas City and Green Bay. Paul, he has everybody else.  Finally, is this one? Dave. Dave and Pennsylvania. Hi, Dave. What's on your mind?  Hi, Danets. Dave. Five, eight, two hundred. I called yesterday. Yeah.  Go to the Spring St. Concert and my grandson being born. And I find it funny that immediately  guy who can't I'm pork. Start pounding on Spring St.  Okay. How mad did it make you, Dave?  I had this pounding out of my chest right now. Maybe it's because of the. Maybe it's because of  the first you. I don't know. Yeah, I keep telling Fritzie like, what does he have it again?  I have against Bruce Springstein. I don't know what the inability to rhyme has to do with.  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I would sing for a C but for a guy who's a.  Oh, a whole notes fan might not understand that. Okay. There's shots being fired here.  All notes are legends. I wish they still were buddies, but I guess they don't talk to each other anymore.  Yeah. I mean, I only have to sing together. You don't want to like each other. A lot of bands that  didn't like each other. They won't go on. They won't go on shows together. They won't do anything. Yeah. It's very  sad. Yeah.

But the buzz in the place, it just was different.  I had to keep reminding myself that it's January 8th.  So easy does it.  But it had a spectacular field.  You could tell the players were so fired up and so into it.  You know, they're all trying to say it's a regular game.  But it wasn't they knew it.  The crowd knew it.  It was it was really wonderful for a game on January 8th.  When you do a show, when you if it's on the mothership or radio show,  whatever you like to play the hits.  And the Cavaliers aren't playing the hits.  But they've gotten to that point, Mike, they're 32 and four.  I can't ignore the topic.  This is one of the great starts in the history of the NBA.  Do you get that sense of people are really struggling to grab a hold of this?  Certainly Cleveland.  Oklahoma City, we expect them to be maybe there in the finals.  Cleveland, they've been a really good team but they just haven't been in the headlines because  LeBron's gone.  Good.  Couldn't agree more.  It's like I even said in our open, I repeated the record to Richard Jefferson, not because he didn't.  He didn't know it.  Obviously, you knew it.  But it just sounds crazy to say that the Cleveland Cavs are 32 and four.  And they're that good.  They're really that good.  And I think the fact that the betting line now still has the Boston Celtics.  The clear favorite to come out of the East, despite the fact that the Cavs are doing this.  And it's a credit to the whole organization from Kobe Altman who made the roster.  The patients to keep the roster and not make sudden changes because they lost in the first round  two years ago and got beaten pretty badly in a second round last year, although it was injuries.  They just, they play such fun basketball to watch because they play team basketball.  I have a bet here with Marvin and I think there'll be two Cavaliers named to the All-Star  team he says four.  Well, before I think three is a really good bet.  I think it's Mitchell Mowbley and in Darryus, Garland, although Jared Allen the last couple  of weeks he played as well as any of them.  So it's going to be interesting to see.  I think four's a lot because Boston has definitely two New York has definitely two.  Although there's a couple of normal guys that aren't going to make it.  So I wouldn't count it out.  They certainly deserve it.  It's like you said.  It's one of the great of any era of any team of any franchise.  It's one of the greatest starts that the league has ever seen.  If you were going to describe Shay Gilchius Alexander to somebody who hadn't seen him play,  how would you do it?  I'm a magical control of his body in the matter where he goes, the matter what he does, an incredible  poison.  Where nobody can speed him up and nobody can really stop him.  Killer instinct and even though he's average at so many points he is such a team first guy.  Everything about him is hard to do it in just a quick sentence.  He's got this supreme confidence but at the same time humility.  He's just a perfect guy to take over the throne of the superstars now with some of our  great aging.  Everything about him is just wonderful from the league standpoint in terms of being the guy that  could lead the next generation.  I kind of see some quiet Leonard comes with him because he had an ability when he was healthy to  control the tempo of a game, not necessarily a three point shooter but had that ability to"

He's smoking out the smoke.  He might be smoking a heater.  But it's something you want to just have.  If we can, if we could get in touch with him,  you would have thought that Mario would be producing this,  where we would have Jay here to accept his award.  Vegas didn't have Jay on the board.  Jay was not on the board.  And I did say to the big German.  Um, and by the way, Mario was so sure that it was going to be  Dylan.  Mario better, pie to the face.  Oh, oh, oh, no.  So Mario not only loses the BRG trophy.  He will get a pie to the face coming up at the end of the show.  So if we can locate Jay and he was probably outside,  you know, it's really unfortunate is that one of the BRG's had to go get Jay to bring him out here to be like here.  You're the person that won.  Yeah.  There he comes.  See, that's a guy.  Hey.  Hey.  All right, Jay.  Come over here and get your trophy.  Oh, what a great moment.  What a stunner.  Look at that.  There you go, buddy.  You're welcome, Jay.  There he is.  So many new ports tonight.  Yeah.  All the new ports.  Well done.  Figure out for everybody.  Thank you, Jay.  Jay did a wonderful job this year.  And right on cue, they have to get him from back.  He's out there working.  And he, of course, is the brother of the big German.  Eric, the big German.  So.  Here we go.  Yes, it was busy touring the roof.  That's why he was late to accept the award.  We're going to get him down with the ladder and everything.  Yeah, buddy.  Wow.  Okay, we're in it.  So.  Mario, you're an idiot.  Okay.  I just opened the least valuable den at.  There's nothing in here.  And then I opened the most valuable den at.  Then there's two things in here.  That is classic.  What is that?  Okay.  All right.  That is classic.  What do you like this is why you you're getting a pilot.  I didn't give you a pilot of the face right now.  I wish you could be more like Jay.  Probably should that MVP, RG after.  Okay.  Do we want to do least valuable den at the start?  Todd.  Yeah, you go least.  You guess.  I thought it was at your announcement.  Just right to it.  Todd.  I'm going to go myself for least valuable den at."

Fritzi said something yesterday about how the Colts are going to be.  Taking back down to hurt a little bit.  And I don't know where there's, quote, of elite defense came from for the Broncos.  But they kind of look like how garbage against Tennessee on Sunday.  So Fritzi, pie to the face challenge.  Broncos winner, I'll take a pie.  Cold span you take a pie.  Yeah, let's do it. Why not?  I got somebody other bets going.  But now the Broncos should beat the Colts and Daniel Joe should be brought back down a couple of  notches.  So that should be a Bronco victory.  It'd be very disappointed.  And I'll get a pie in the face if that doesn't happen.  I forgot that we have cameras on at all time.  Even though this is a radio show, but when that bug was in my headphone,  Mario, who's the Eisen years of the show, you said that we have a bug gate.  He has the video.

You ever see those videos on the internet?  Somebody like they're clearly having an issue with their ear and they're like,  Ah, and it's like they're in the hospital or at a doctor's office.  And they have tweezers and they go into the person's ear and then all of a sudden they pull out like a three inch  off.  It's a crazy thing.  Wait till you have Facebook feed gets onto that.

How long do you have to be on a Facebook page before then it changes your algorithm?  It's time spent.  When you pause, it's soaking it in.  When you click like it's even more.  Okay.  Let's say you're scrolling.  You pause on clips from good fellas.  You'll start getting clips from good fellas.  It really takes almost no time.  Even if somebody can even text you and be like, hey, you ever seen good fellas and you can write back,  no.  And then when you open your computer, one of the very first things you're going to see on like Facebook is a good fellas thing.  Yeah, I know that's crazy.  That bothers the crap out.  Yeah.

Let me ask Pauli if he was bothered by that being the older Peyton apologist.  It was clearly unintentional by Jim Nance.  He'll have to answer for it, but it seemed unintentional by Mr. Nance.  Thank you, Bemis.  Sorry that that's bothered you.  I bothered me, but I got over it.  Marcus Allen used to do that, too.  He loved watching Walter Peyton grow up.  You could do Sam Bam Cunning Hand.  That's very fair.  You could say that. Sam Bam Cunning Hand.  Joe in Orlando.  Hi, Joe.  What's on your mind today?  I would be doing that happy Thursday.  Dan, that says well, 510, 180.  It's a beautiful day down here in Orlando,  and I'm actually getting ready to head down to the studio as I am a student of the program here at Full Cell.  So thank you for the opportunity and the knowledge that you and the program directors provide to us.  It's amazing what we have on our hands down here.  So on first, I want to mention the Stewart Scott documentary from last night.  Being an aspiring sports broadcast, you're not only that I learned a lot about Stewart, but I learned a lot about the industry and finding yourself in the industry.  So that was a beautiful watch and yeah, your hair does go five times platinum in the documentary.  So I do recommend the watch.  But what I am calling about is the Denver Broncos man.  The Bones nicks and the Broncos have rattled off 10 straight wins.  They come back home to Denver this week against the Packers and their other dogs.  So I just want to see what your take. Do you think the Broncos will be able to close out the season and the AFC at the number one seed?  They have some pretty hard games, jagged of nine wins, the chiefs or the chiefs and it's an arrowhead.  The charges are also a nine win team at the division opponent.  So do you think they'll be able to close out the AFC?  The Patriots have a little bit of a less hard schedule.  So what's your thoughts on that?  Well, you know what? This comes down to Sean Payton and Bones.  Because that defense will travel.  I'm just not sure about that offense.  And Patriots that schedule not is demanding.  But Denver has been a great story this year.  Todd, when you want to give me the pie to the face following our Raiders Broncos bat.  That came down to the wire. I mean, it got pretty close.  I'm going to do two and eleven. Yes. Yes.  But when do you want to give me a pie to the face?  Whenever you're up for it, we could do it next Friday, man.  Okay.  I think there's a few people need pies to the face, Marvin.  You need one. I need two. Two of them, see?  Well, am I supposed to get a spray tan?  Uh, or did I imagine that?  I feel like just like sometime in the last week some night call then was like,  Hey, you only a spray tan.  Yes. I don't know what that's from.  I know bad Larry lost a bet on the gambling podcast has to do a spray.  Maybe we could do a two for one.  You and bad Larry stripped down and do a spray tan.  And I could not do a spray tan.  Why not?  I don't know.  Just kind of creepy.  For a guy?  I can't do that.  I did meet a woman. Her job is to give spray tan in New York City.  She was telling me all the famous people come in.  And I was like, oh, okay.  Yeah, pulling.  I'm looking for bakery slash tanning spies right now.  Business that does both.  Oh, not a lot of them out there.  So, I was like a hole in the market.  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  I'm in for it to get a pie, but while I'm waiting, I'm going to get a spray tan.  Why not?  I like it.  How about this day in sports history, Paul?  Just a couple of days.  Joe de Majo retired 1951 played all 13 years with the Yankees.  Mohamed Ali retired in 1981.  His last fight was Trevor Burbic.  And Merrill Amu came back to play and became a player owner, the first in NHL history.  But Ali lost his fight to Trevor Burbic.  Correct.  It was a unanimous decision with Mohamed Ali.  Uh, I'm a, say anything else that needs to be mentioned here.  Yes, Paul.  I do have a name for Michigan.  And some people are throwing this out there on the social media.  And it makes a lot of sense.  Uh, Kenny Dillingham, the head coach of Arizona State.

Chicago, I had, if they moved the, the suburbs, they might.  It's Cleveland going to build a dome staying.  I'm with you.  I mean, it does create a better experience for the fans, climate controlled.  It's better for the players, but we do like to see the elements.

You didn't expect solid 180.  Hey, um, so do you think with all the field related injuries, do you think the NFL and  the NFL P A are going to see think adding an 18th regular season game down the road?  My thought process is if the owners don't want to fork out the money to fix the field, why would  the players want to make them more money?  They want to make more money.  We're, we're heading towards 18 games.  Absolutely.  Players are going to get another paycheck.  A lot of times, and, and I talked to two former players.  And I said, what did you, this was two, two and a half weeks ago.  And I said, what do you think about an 18th game?  And they say, we never think we're going to be the one who gets injured.  You can't go out there thinking at another 18th, you know, an 18th game, another game, I'm going  to run my risk, uh, even higher of getting hurt.  They don't think that way because you can't think that way.  All you think is another game, another paycheck.  Uh, Marcus and Jacksonville.  Hi, Marcus.  Good morning, Dan.  I've got a pie to the face bet for Fritzie here.  The Jacksonville Jaguar's, my Jacksonville Jaguar's are going into Denver to beat the Broncos  ass on Sunday.  Wow.  I'm going to spot him.  I'm going to spot him 13 points because we're winning by at least two touchdowns.  And we're going to win the Super Bowl.  I'll take it off here.  Wow.  He's got the Jaguars winning by two touchdowns in Denver.  He's given you 13 points.  I would have probably taken that as a straight up win for Denver.  So I will totally go in with that.  Yeah, I can't blame you.  I'm looking at Super Bowl odds now.  Ram, C Hawks, Broncos, Bills, Texans, Eagles, Patriots, Packers, Jags, aren't even on here.  They're not in the top eight right now with Super Bowl odds.  Uh, that's a, that was a bold proclamation there.  I'm going to see a New Orleans, I Billy, what's on your mind?  Uh, I had the honor of the 13, uh, Dan, I have two comments of yelling, Jolt and Dullsme,  uh, the first comment in the main reason I called is, in reference to the playing surface study  being conducted by the NFL, uh, I'm sure they're comparing injury prevalence by surface, but  I look under and I highly doubt, by the way, is, are they also going to consider the long-term  health risk of turf?  Uh, they've been several studies that, uh, reference the carcinogens and possible effects of,  of, uh, of turf on, uh, on long-term health.  Uh, I know the NFL often listen to your shows, so I just wanted to point this out to park  Avenue.  Um, and I, I, I, I this a little bit lighter, uh, I think Paul is brought this up before and of all  years.  I think this would be a very interesting topic or, or, or, or, uh, proposal.  Uh, and I know it won't ever happen.  But, uh, if the NFL play a team could draft like archiving for example this year, knowing  you're going back to Texas, but then next year he's on their team, uh, I just, I feel like that  would make a very interesting, uh, draft."

And now we're going to be  well, wait, Matt, did he give himself up? Is that a fumble? You know, the competition committee's got  this is difficult because they go out of their way to make sure they're protecting the quarterback.  And you want to do that, I just want to make sure the quarterback is going to protect himself and he  does it need the official to protect him. And it feels like the officials are the ones protecting the  quarterbacks. The quarterbacks aren't necessarily protecting themselves. Yes, Tom.

I have to check  with the league, but there certainly should be because it happens a lot. Yeah, Paul. There's an NFL rule  for un-sportsmanly conduct. It doesn't have any language about flopping.

So should the engagement be a toilet to getting married?  Should at least get a engagement pie of the face?  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Hold on.  Let me just vote on that.  How about an engagement pie to the face for Todd?  Not a wedding kick.  I got a jump and it said, why does that assuming that I'm against their relationship?  I, I want them to break up and I think it was publicity.  I never said any of those things.  I'm glad they're together.  I don't like the chiefs, but I got nothing against Travis.

And I even said to Mary or the director, I said, oh, that's not good.  I think he said that Taylor Swift has 10 songs better than Prince's best song.  And I went, let's don't do that.  You don't need to go down that road.  Taylor Swift doesn't have 10 songs better than whatever song you want to pick with Prince, if  purple rain.  She does not have 10 songs better than that.  Yes, you can.  How many songs does she have?  Just maybe three.  No, I wouldn't.  I wouldn't take now.  She's an incredible songwriter.  She is.  But let's, how about they can just live in their separate worlds there?  We don't need to bring them together.  Just let's rest his soul, Prince.  Don't want to ruin his day where all of a sudden we're talking about him, compared to Taylor Swift."

Knowing you're going to have to ask the tough questions about your own more.  And then I noticed you like ended with some lighter questions than not in the interview on the  show on more note. It was just like such a great interview just curious what kind of  strategizing with like Paul and the crew there is pre-show with these specific interviews.  Well we come up with the concepts, the topics and then I wanted to be open-ended questions.  You know that one wasn't where I said when I said when's the last time you talked to him.  Assuming that he would give me that. And I was surprised that he did go a  little more than I thought but we do talk about it but you can't start with that.  And I think we were talking about I don't know. Football fields or knee braces or something.  But you have to have a beginning middle and end. You could ask great questions but if the person  you're asking the questions two doesn't want to answer them then it doesn't become a good interview.  Jim answered the questions or at least the best that I could hope for. In fact he gave me more than I  thought but there is a strategy that goes into some of these interviews when you know you're going to ask sensitive topics.  Todd, did you learn anything today? I did the best advice Ryan Leap ever received about calling games on the  radio came from Curt Warner just tell your story of the game. Satan what did you learn today? Ryan Leap spent the  day with Tom Brady. Marvin, Gick Lambert not gorgeous. Nobody's wife, Vicki was. All we picked  put I would pick a putter to save our lives. Todd, what did I learn? We all wonder why we embrace him and  crave upsets during March, but not when it comes to the college football player. Most cars on the road could  use little TLC at makeo they bring you car back the life affordable paint jobs like legendary pairs get a  free estimate today. Uh oh better get make up you're watching on peacock. Todd gives me a pie to the face  losing my bet a close bet the Raiders who in the Broncos who would have a better season.

I get it. Do I think David Teper is  involved in this? Absolutely. If he was involved in drafting Bryce Young, I'm going to imagine  he's probably involved in benching. Right, sure. But if you say Bryce's our quarterback and then  all of a sudden you say Andy don't give us a better chance to win, it feels like we have to spin this.  Got to make it positive. Keep it vague and hopefully move on.  Paulie has a way too early. Pied to the face bet way too early. Pied to the face bet. Ready? Absolutely.  For the 20 25 NFL draft, the first pick of the entire draft will not be a quarterback.  Will not. Well, not. Over the past 10 years, it's about 75% of the time. It's a quarterback. I think  there's going to be like six quarterbacks taken in round one, but not with the first pick. Okay, back to you.  All right. Does anybody want a piece of the way too early? Pied to the face bet that a quarterback  is not selected number one overall. Marvin? No. Oh, backing. You kind of got in a little  fritzy like a little soft when it comes to, you know, I believe somebody's going to come out of nowhere  and be the first quarterback taking. Wait, so you can make the bet. Paulie says that quarterback won't  be number one overall and you said that you agree. So what is it? You know what, I'm going to take that  bet. You are. I'll take the bet. Okay. Easily manipulated. Yeah, it's true. It's called content.  All right. Are you comfortable with that? No. No. Course not. Wait, I don't want to pressure you  into taking a pie to the face. There's worse thing. I mean you're soft, but yes, yes, see.  Would Paul be willing to say that it will not be a quarterback. Nor will it be.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm not going to be pressured in the back. You will not be  give me some space. You will not be okay. Okay. All right. So Marvin, you're taking the bet.  Yeah. Quarterback is going to be taking first, right? That's what you're saying. Yes. Paul is saying,  no. Yes, Paul. And I almost want to make a prediction if the Carolina gets the number one pick,  they don't go quarterback and they love shiny toys down there. I could see them flirting with Travis Hunter  from Colorado. The novelty of him, the entertainment value of him, whether it be them or other.  Where is Travis Hunter on the Heismanons? I haven't seen updated odds, but  guys been pretty incredible. Yeah, Paul. I got, oh, they're floating around here,  camward of Miami, Jalen Milro, Jackson, Dart, Carson back. No one's taking it. Queen  U.S. is in the mix. No favorite as of now. I don't have, is Travis Hunter in the top,  checking six or seven, well, please, for can I get it. Maybe, maybe picture day,  Ray can reach out to draft King. So nice. Well, at top, Tanner, right? He should be, he should be one of the  front runners. I have him in one place at plus 3,500. The team's not good.  His story is great though. Whether two and one. Talk to us in two months. You don't believe?  Do you believe now? Travis Hunter has the story on his side.

He's the right quarterback for this system. It doesn't cost  them anything that's going to cost them a lot. It's allowed them to keep the talent, the collective,  together. That's all. It's just a context of it that gets lost by people. He's the right guy.  Right now, and he's done a really good job. I have nothing against him. People get offended.  It's everything's personal to you. It's not to me. I just call it as I see it.  I have no agenda here with this. Yes, I do appreciate when we get the, like, guys, would you drop the  agenda, huh?

I have the hell are we supposed to drill down that far? Yeah. Yeah. I think you got systemic  problems there. It's not when you roll to your left. You're really good with your pass blocking there.

I'm not quite sure.  I mean, the Ravens are going to Dallas now. You got Dallas after a humbling home loss to the saints.  Is that must win?  For the Ravens? Yes. Must win? Yes. It is. Yeah.  Right? Because it'd be 0 and 3. Oh, really. That's what happens. Yeah. It's usually what happens. Yeah. You go  0 and then you lose, then you go in 3. Be fair to Barbara. I checked it. Did you? Okay.

But this is what the Yankees did. And the Yankees had all that extra money from the  yes network. I mean, they created something that nobody else could take advantage of or did take advantage of.  The Dodgers are kind of doing the same thing. Yeah, Paulie. Did you want to play? Let's play the Dodgers  payroll game. We haven't played that a couple of years. All right. So going into next season, what's the Dodgers  payroll? Yes, projected payroll as of right now. All right, Todd. 427 million. Okay. I'll give you a hint.  A team like the St. Louis Cardinals is that 148 million and they're kind of in the middle of the  entire league. All right. Satan Dodgers payroll next year. I'm going to say it's almost exactly  double what Paul just said. 400 in was it? But you say 448 million? Yes. Something like that.  Todd said. I'm sorry. You said 148 for the card of the Cardinals? Yes. 140. Yes. Sorry. That's what I'm  trying to say. So you guys. So it would be double what the cardinals is. 280 million. Maybe closer to like  326. 326. Yeah. 326. Marvin. 312 million. I'm going to go 358. 5369 million dollars for the Dodgers.  Yeah. In comparison, the Metz are at 297. Philly's 288. The Yankees 284. Okay. What is the lowest payroll in  baseball? Estimated for 2025. It's not Oakland because or Sacramento now. They're actually spending money.  Ish. They're at 74 million second to last. Okay. Okay. So they're they're not last. Yes, Marvin.  I'm going to go with the marlins at 34 million dollars. It's a marlins at 67 million. 34. Those are my marlins.  Yeah. Hey, but every five years I win a world series. So I'm with seeing. I also have an issue with the  playoff system expanding. The marlins. I'm almost certain. I'll take a pie to the face if this is true.  Why? I don't think they have a division title. I don't think they've ever wanted to be division title,  but they have two soups. I'm a two soups. Two world series championships. That's ridiculous. He's correct.  You're fired up here over the marlins. So they get in with 84 wins. Yeah. They end up winning the  world series. Yeah. They were kind of the diamond backs before the diamond backs. This last diamond  back team that went to the world series. Just get in. Yes, Paul. But if you don't have things like this,  you don't have the Eli Manning Superballs. If you don't have the Wild card. Yeah, Wild cards.  I think the Packers were a Wild card with Aaron Rodger. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, great. Wild card. Yeah.  Well, you don't like the Wild card. You like you want your division? Yeah. Kind of in today.  Baseball wise. Oh, okay. I'm a pierce. Well, remember when they used to just have one division. Like you  you want your division. You got to go to the world series. Oh, I'm with that. Yeah. Are you just two teams at the end of the year?  The two best teams at an actual league. And then, basically. Yes, Todd. When the Dodgers and Braves  putting the same division. That made a lot of sense. Well, the Dodgers, Braves and the Reds. All the  And it was actually West. The Reds in Ohio and the Braves in Atlanta. They're in the West. Yes,  see. When you look at like these websites and they have the payroll things. And it says total payroll.  Yeah. And then right next to that, it says active payroll. So the Marlins say their total payroll  according to this, right, is about $43 million. But their active payroll is almost $29 million.  Is that the stuff that like they're still paying out like, oh, we signed this guy, but we owe him a million  dollars a year for the next five years. So that goes in the active. That goes in the total payroll for this year.  I'm guessing active payroll is just, well, these are the guys we're really playing.  Yes, feels like that. Feels like a significant amount of money that goes over. Yeah.  Yes, well, what would it be great one time to be on an inactive payroll? Pay to not do anything.  Like a coach that gets fired and has three more years on his contract. The nationals total payroll this year  is $75.2 million. Their active payroll is $49 million.  That's almost twice as much.

A gentle apple pie heading into Christmas, nothing wrong with that.  Do you want to put some whipped cream on it?  I thought I'd kind of throw some egg nog over your head if we're going to go all the way with the Christmas spirit.  No, both, we should do a little whipped cream on the apple.  But we don't drink egg nog any other time of the year, do we?  We don't.  I don't think anyone really drinks that.  Look at me.  Is that a win-breaker you got on?  Is that old school deep in?  I don't...  I don't use that expression win-breaker as much as I used to.  It should be a good time to use it.  Yeah, that should be a good time to use it.  Yeah, that should be a good time to use it.  Yeah, that should be a good time to use it.  You got to win-breaker.  Like Jacket.  Yeah.  What's the t-shirt underneath?  T-shirt underneath is...  Oh.  That's never meant to be.  It's all sandblissed, man.  It's came in the mail yesterday.  It looks like it was a rams shirt.  Wait, why did you get it?  I got a bunch of stuff from my son who recently...  Oh, I think I knew that it came here.  No, no, I ordered this as a gift with a bunch of other things.  Oh, oh.  I wanted to wear something rams underneath.  Okay.  Good luck for tonight.  But if the rams played the Broncos...  I would have to refer the Broncos.  Broncos are my team.  Okay.  I made that very clear with my son and that's just the way to...  If they meet each other in the Super Bowl for some reason, they keep the one seeds and go all the way.  I got to refer again.  Are you more of a wee with the Broncos than Travis Kelsey is with the shapes?  Yes.  Okay.  As long as Bowenix keeps that wind streak alive and we keep going forward, that they're definitely a wee.  I love it.  I love it.  Scott and Fort Wayne.  Hi Scott.  What's on your mind today?  Hi Dad.  I was thinking this week what's right inside the 2020...

I don't think it would have this fairly helped though.  Yeah.  As Jim Harball said that if you played offensive line or defensive line at Michigan when he was there,  it was mandatory you had the where these knee braces.  But it feels like you see this, it's pretty common now.  Certainly with college football.  And those contraptions, I wore knee brace all through high school and college.  But these are really intricate.  These are almost like Frankenstein stuff where it's like...  ...  ...  ...  ...  I know it doesn't affect knee injuries.  I'm not saying that.  But I wish football players would wear their pants to their knee and over their knee like they used to.  They're basically wearing pre-pants or shorts these days.  Joe and Ohio.  Hi Joe.  What's on your mind?  Hey Dad.  First time long time.  ...  ...  ...  Yeah, thanks.  Going into, you know, the college football play office.  We can, the athletic did a survey with power four and group of five coaches.  I'm who the best coach going into the college football playoff.  And Ryan Day did not receive a single vote while Kirby and Cincinnati received almost all of them.  You know, there's been this notion that Ryan Day was born on their pay up to their base, you know, over the last six, seven years.  And the seat needs a net that's a bad national title to get over that hump or is the notion still going to be there.  And one more thing again, I got a, in the spirit of pies that are face, I got a buck I pie to the face for anyone Ohio State versus the rest of the field.  So Joe's taking Ohio State and you can have everybody else in the playoffs, including two lane and James Madison.  Yeah.  Does anybody want a piece of Joe?  I kind of do.  You're on a pie betting spring.  I must be hungry or something.  I betting spring.  Yeah, I'll take that one too.  Yeah, you know, I just took.  I have the piesman back here.  Oh, the piesman trophy that was sent in.  So I have Ohio State losing at some point, just not winning the national championship.  Yeah.  And then, oh, Seattle winning tonight.  Yeah, straight up straight up straight up.  I don't know about the Ryan Day thing, but, you know, Jim Harbaugh's the one that talked about Ryan Day woke up on third base at Ohio State.  He inherited an unbelievable team.  And they probably do year and year out have more, they're going to have probably five first round draft picks.  Maybe maybe more than that this year.  And so, and, and, you know, you have a receiver and their quarterback, not eligible to be drafted.  Or they might be first round draft picks as well.  But yeah, Harbaugh's the one that said that.  And I think it's, and there is some truth to that.  It's like Barry Switzer took over for Jimmy Johnson and got a super bowl.  But Ryan Day has had some sustained greatness here.  And you did win an national title.  Winning another one.  Feels like, okay, you won one.  But you got to be pretty good to win two, or at least I would, I would hope that that how he would be viewed.  Paul, this day in sports history.  I got a couple for you, Dan. I got Nate Thurman.  You just mentioned the other day, 1977 the calves retired is number 42.  Will Chamberlain in 61 had 78 points against the Lakers.  And, oh, 2002, a press conference held down now.  It's held down now, it's that the Robert Johnson was a new owner of the NBA's Charlotte franchise.  I was a stalk. And that's it.  Let's go around the room.  What we learned on the program Todd, would you learn today?  Michael Irvin believes KC has to start retooling and building more town around their superman Patrick Mahomes.

So we're going to find out here in the next month if everybody's all in on the Colts.  Then if I look at the divisional leaders in the NFC, San Francisco's at the Giants,  host the Rams at the Cardinals and then they host the Panthers.  They got to get healthy.  But then you're not getting Fred Warner or Boaseau, not coming back.  I wonder if they make a trade for maybe a defensive player.  Buck and ears.  By week host the Patriots at the Bills at the Rams.  Wow.  Eagles by week at the Falcons.  They host the Lions at the Cowboys.  That could be tough sledding.  Green Bay got the Panthers.  Got the Eagles at home at the Giants and then you'll host the Vikings.  No, the divisional leaders there.  Whatever that means to you.  But it did take up a little bit of time.  Yes, Pauling.  Seeing that we're saying, pardon the illiteration.  Are you saying that next Sunday is Separation Sunday?  I barely made it through that.  Like bears Bengals.  Someone's done for the year after this.  Someone's right out of the picture.  I kind of feel like we just had separation Sunday.  Are we going back to back separation Sundays?  Can't do it back to back.  I thought it was college football that did the labeling.  Separation Saturday.  Yeah.  Come and get up.  Separation Saturday.  Penn State Ohio State.  Some rooms.  Sounds more like necessary November.  You just gave like the three next three four games for each of the top teams.  necessary November.  Thank you, Todd, for repeating it.  Appreciate that.  Like Broncos Texans next week.  Texans make a little push.  But the Broncos.  That's it.  Trippin Vegas.  I trippin worse to the weekend.  Hey, D.T.  I got the best in worse than the double.  Pied of the face.  But my best in worse happened in the same game.  My self-kill on a game cock.  And about 90 seconds went from butt kick and chicken to fried chickens.  Then on the double pie of the face bed.  I looked for this as firm as to for it.  I will take the Jaguiers.  Excuse me.  The Raiders this weekend against the Jaguiers.  And then I'll take the Raiders against the Broncos on the seventh.  And then when I see y'all in a couple of weeks.  We'll pick our pie.  But we have to win both games to get a pie of the face.  Okay.  Are you in Jacksonville?  For the almondless Davis.  No.  Is that game in Jacksonville?  Always here.  Both games are here.  I'll be at both games.  Oh.  Okay.  I'll be at the Raiders.  I'll be there this weekend.  And then I'll be there for the games.  But you already owed Todd a pie to the face.  No, no.  I don't know.  I don't know anything.  I always pick on Todd.  But I'm trying to get him to do a 2-in-a-0 series bet.  Todd, he's got the Broncos losing to the Raiders and the Jags losing to the Raiders for a pie to the face.  So the way I understand it, the Raiders have to beat the Jaguiers and Broncos.  They're next to games.  Is that a game?  No, we both.  That's simple.  No, we hate to have to lose both or win both to lose the bet.  But when I see you in a couple of weeks at Fomereal at one, one of us will be one up and one down.  And we will decide which pie the other will get if we lose the second bet.  Guess, Paulie.  I have a question for the room.  The last caller said Jaguiers.  Yes.  Weiss.  I have a buddy who's been calling them the Jaguiers for 20 years.  Is there any chance we're wrong and they're right?  What's not spelled that way?  That would be it's Jaguiers.  It's not Jaguiers.  Right.  But some people still say that.  I think you're a peon.  People will say Jaguiers.  They say Jaguars.  Jaguars.  Yeah.  I think that's it's closer to that.  Tripp.  You don't have any takers here.  But thank you.  I don't think I thought we were going to say the breeders are not going to be the Jaguars.  Adam Broncos.  Yeah.  I thought that was the bet.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Jaguars.  We used to make fun of it on sports.  I remember when I was there with the Oberman.  And we were like Jaguars.  Jaguars.  By the way, I picked up a copy of Spin Magazine.  Whoa.  All right.  Oh, look at you.  And I didn't know they were still in business.  I've shocked to hear it.  I used to read Spin Magazine all the time.  Special place in my heart.  They were the first publication to do something on the Big Show on Sports Center.  And they were ahead of the game with that with the others that followed.  But I remember they came in and did a story on myself and Keith Oberman, the Big Show.  But it was fun reading spin and getting suggestions on different things.  I think they're 40th anniversary, 40 years of spin magazine with Kurt Cobain on the cover."
